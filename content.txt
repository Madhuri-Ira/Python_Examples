pressplay boosie has a few things to say about regarding dwade and his daughter zaya

a post shared by the shade room theshaderoom on feb 18 2020 at 917am pst ; manu tuilagi and henry slade are winning their fitness battles as england aim to build momentum in their guinness six nations title quest

the outside centres have been recovering from respective groin and ankle injuries and are on course to be available for sundays pivotal clash with ireland at twickenham

tuilagi suffered a minor strain in the opening quarter against france in round one and sat out the calcutta cup victory over scotland with jonathan joseph deputising in his absence

slade meanwhile has not appeared since damaging his ankle in december but was involved in wednesday mornings training session at englands surrey training base

head coach eddie jones said manu trained fully so should be in contention for selection its good to have a quality player back

slade also trained so we have just got to monitor his progress he has a positive chance hes a quality player this gives gives us more options

the return of two key midfield personnel has come at a welcome time for england after ollie devoto became a doubt for the visit of andy farrells men to twickenham because of a back issue

tuilagis ability to power over the gainline will be especially important against ireland as mako vunipola  another explosive carrier  will miss the clash for family reasons

vunipola is returning home joining his younger brother billy on the list of absentees with the marauding number eight ruled out for the entire six nations because of a broken arm

in makos absence joe marler and ellis genge will fill in as starting and replacement loosehead props

makos a quality player but we are lucky we are blessed with two outstanding loosehead props in joe and ellis so we can recover the loss of mako but its disappointing to lose him jones said

the scrummaging technique of ireland prop tadhg furlong has been called into question by wales in the wake of their 2414 defeat in dublin and jones has revealed that england will talk to referee jaco peyper in advance of sundays collision

the scrum is the place for the dark arts what one person sees as right another person sees as wrong jones said

the welsh are entitled to their opinion well formulate ours and let the referee decide on the verdict

ireland are a good side extremely well coached and we really respect them they were well coached by joe schmidt and andy is doing a great job now

ireland are our next game so its our most important we are on track

the louisianaborn rapper has been under fire after he condemned wades decision to support zayas transition earlier this month

during an interview with good morning america this week wade revealed that his 12yearold whom he shares with exwife siohvaughn funches knew from an early age she was different and had long been aware of her gender identity  it just took her father a little longer to catch up

shes known it for nine years shes known since she was 3 years old wade 38 said along this way weve asked questions and weve learned but shes known

i knew early on that i had to check myself he explained to gma thats what i knew i knew early on that i had to ask myself questions

ive been a person in a locker room that has been a part of the conversation that has said the wrong phrases and the wrong words myself wade continued as i got older and i watched my daughter grow i had to go and look at myself in the mirror and say who are you what are you going to do if your child comes home and says dad im not a boy  im a trans girl what are you going to do that was my moment of real

part of the reason why wade turned inward was because he hadnt ever had anyone else in his life come out as gay as trans as anything

my daughter was my first interaction when it comes to having to deal with this conversation wade said to gma hopefully im dealing with it the right way some people feel that im not but inside our home we see the smile on her face we see the confidence that shes able to walk around and be herself and thats when you know youre doing right

the athlete told roberts that zaya actually helped educate wade and his wife gabrielle union 47 on what it means to be transgender after doing the research herself

she is our leader wade said to gma i think when the conversation we had  the one thing about it for parents is have conversations with your kids zaya early on knew two things she knew straight and she knew gay but zaya started doing more research

he continued she is the one who sat down with us as a family and said hey i dont think im gay and she went down the list this is how i identify myself this is my gender identity i identify myself as a young lady i think im a straight trans because i like boys so it was a process for us to sit down with our daughter and find out who she is and what she likes and not put something on her

view gallery as list ; umar akmal is likely to find himself in hot water with the pcb once more after he is said to have misbehaved with staff during a fitness test at the national cricket academy nca the junior akmal is believed to have exposed himself in frustration during one test and now finds himself facing the prospect of being kicked out of the next domestic tournament

akmals elder brother kamran is also expected to land in trouble after both brothers failed their fitness tests by significant margins salman butt too could be in trouble with the authorities after he stormed out of a fitness test when his request to have it rescheduled was denied

the shortcomings of the akmal brothers around their fitness regimes has been a talking point for several years now with umar last falling foul of the pcb management on this count under former head coach mickey arthur he was sent home on the eve of the champions trophy in 2017 after a failed fitness test kamran meanwhile has not played for pakistan since 2017 with his lack of athleticism in the outfield a major reason for his prolonged exclusion

the perception that the akmal brothers have never quite bought into the importance of maintaining rigorous fitness standards hasnt helped their chances and for all the changes that misbahulhaq has sought to bring since taking over from arthur the managements commitment to high fitness standards remains undiluted misbah has sought to impose the same high standards in domestic cricket with each provincial side required to regulate fitness tests on a quarterly basis

espncricinfo understands umars behavior fell short of the mark during the skinfold test when he exposed himself completely in front of the trainer and is said to have asked him where is the fat according to kamran umar did it in mischief and said it was simply a misunderstanding the pcb confirmed to espncricinfo that they were fully aware of the matter and looking at potential punishments in the context of bringing the game into disrepute umar could potentially be axed from the upcoming domestic oneday cup

kamran meanwhile skipped two fitness tests before ending up failing in nearly all departments when he finally did take one central punjabs squad was called up at the nca in batches with kamran scheduled to appear for his test on january 11 he skipped that test purportedly because he had a photoshoot with peshawar zalmi his test was then pushed back to january 20 only for him to opt out informing the management he was suffering from a bout of fever he would undertake his test on january 28 alongside his brother with both falling well short of the required benchmarks

i had informed the management each time i didnt come kamran told espncricinfo i had reasons and i came on january 28 for the test as far result is concerned you will see an improvement in the next test after the psl

misbah has been repeatedly asked about kamrans absence from the national side most recently for the test squad to face bangladesh in the first test at rawalpindi stadium on saturday both of our openers have scored runs and obviously you only recall a player when there is a place for him misbah had responded certain players are performing so you have to wait

both akmal brothers and butt have not signed any contracts with their provincial teams nor with the pcb and were playing domestic cricket without any contractual obligation ; boosie badazz is now facing face realword repercussions for his transphobic rant against dwyane wade and his 12yearold child zaya

fitness tests in california schools may be suspended for three years over fears of the negative effect the test has on nonbinary students forced to identify as male or female

the states current fitness assessment measures a students body mass index which requires every student to select whether they are male or female a number of school districts have complained to the state that this practice is discriminatory against students who identify as nonbinary

under current requirements california students in grades five seven and nine must take a fitness test that involves a onemile run curlups pushups and a measure of body mass index

the new proposal brought forward by california governor gavin newsom could suspend the current test for three years until a new assessment is developed physical education will still remain a requirement for graduation

california governor gavin newsom pictured talking to students in sacramento wants a threeyear suspension on school physical fitness tests while the state evaluates the model

students hold their position during a yoga class at capri elementary school in california  governor gavin newsom wants a threeyear suspension on physical fitness tests in california schools so the model can be modified or a new assessment be drawn up if required

governor newsom wants to pause physical education tests for students for three years due to concerns over bullying and the test discriminating against disabled and nonbinary students

the move also comes after annual test results show a growing percentage of students scoring not healthy

hd palmer spokesman for the california department of finance said the state has received complaints that the current examinations measurement of body mass index is discriminatory to nonbinary students

a measurement calculated from weight and height bmi screenings require students to select male or female he said

dispelling myths breaking down stereotypes and improving school climate is one way california is working to keep all students safe and healthy consistent with the governors commitment to a california that respects all students palmer said in an email

the issue of bmi screening plays a role in the issues of both body shaming and bullying

california governor gavin newsom tucked a proposal to suspend the states school fitness test for three years over bullying and bodyshaming fears in his education budget bill for next year

students in california pictured above will still be required to complete physical education classes to graduate but may not have to take a school fitness test for three years

the proposal was tucked inside newsoms education budget bill for next year

school districts nationwide use such tests and the exercise can inform growing children about potential health problems experts say

but the results from tests and bmi measurements should not be used to diagnose health risks according to the society of health and physical educators

during the proposed physical fitness test programs suspension the state would study whether the current test should be modified or redrawn anew palmer said

this would involve consulting with experts on fitness physical education gender identity and students with disabilities to decide whether the current test needs to be modified or if a new assessment should be established

physical education classes would remain a requirement for graduation

initiated in 1998 the school tests can include a onemile run pushups and other measurements

annual state reports of the fitness test since the 20142015 school year show a steady decline in the share of students scoring healthy according to a review by the associated press

students scores have particularly dropped in the category of the fitness test that measures aerobic capacity which can be tested in a onemile run or by other methods other categories also test for flexibility and exercises like pushups

in the last five years the percentage of fifth graders scoring healthy in the aerobic category has dropped by 33 percentage points in seventh and ninth grades the drops are 44 percentage points and 38 percentage points respectively

former california governor arnold schwarzenegger right visiting a sacramento school 2007 critics of the bmi test point out that according the the test schwarzenegger would have been officially classified obese when he won the top bodybuilding title of mr olympia in 1974

critics of bmi argue that according to the test arnold schwarzenegger pictured here training for mr olympia in 1977 would have been classified as obese when he won mr olympia in 1974

meanwhile the percentage of students identified as needing improvement and having a health risk went up by 33 percentage points among fifth graders 44 for seventh graders and 38 among ninth graders

the department of education did not immediately comment on those results

bodybuilder and former california governor arnold schwarzenegger had several school fitness initiatives during his time in office he said through a spokesman that physical education classes should be the top priority

whether the state uses fitness tests or not governor schwarzenegger believes that the most important thing is that our students have access to daily physical education classes to promote a healthy and fit lifestyle said daniel ketchell a spokesman for schwarzenegger

ketchell agreed that bmi screenings are flawed

he said for instance that the 6foot2inch and 240pound schwarzenegger would have been officially classified obese when he won the top bodybuilding title of mr olympia in 1974 ; new delhi praveen kumar hurries into anand vihar railway station where he has to receive a relative after looking around for the platform ticket counter he approaches the helpdesk for assistance instead of guiding him to the relevant counter the staff point to an electric blue machine festooned with garlands kumar notices the fit india squat machine written on it the 35yearold is informed that if he manages 30 squats on the machine in 180 seconds he will get a platform ticket for free in the next minute and a half he catches his breath before smilingly receiving a slip giving him access to the platform

as part of its effort to improve amenities at the station indian railway stations development corporation limited irsdc installed the machine not only to meet fit india campaign goals but also to make the railway station interactive and fun for passengers this is the first time that such an exercise machine common in many stations abroad has been installed in india the fit india squat kiosk is in line with the prime ministers vision more squat machines will soon be installed across the country said an irsdc official

gaurav chaudhary of irsdc stationed at the helpdesk disclosed that over 200 people had tried the machine since its installation on thursday with many keen to beat the time target people who have time are willing to give the exertion a go some have even tried completing the 30 squats in less than a minute said chaudhary

a signboard will take over the task of informing people from the helpdesk since the machine is new we are here to guide people about how to go about it no buttons need be pressed the machines sensors detect a person automatically and start the count explained chaudhary the machine senses whether the squat is correct and low enough or not

among other facilities recently installed is the pulse health kiosk it allows people to measure parameters such as body composition analysis and blood pressure there is also a robocura massage chair bottle crushing machines and a dawa dost outlet where people can buy medicines at a discount of up to 80

s k lohia md and ceo irsdc said we are committed to redeveloping the station to give passengers worldclass amenities this is a good opportunity for interested parties to invest too ; toussaint uses his socialmedia clout to promote peloton and other brands including lebron james new sports nutrition company ladder

fitness influencer alex toussaint got his start mopping floors as a facility coordinator at a cycling studio in east hampton new york

he knew he wanted to be an instructor and paid close attention to what trainers were doing while he performed maintenance work

i was mopping with purpose he told business insider when i was cleaning outside of the room i was listening to the instructors

another trainer encouraged toussaint to ask their employer flywheel sports if he could try out a role as a cycling instructor the company agreed and he earned a spot teaching classes in east hampton then manhattan and eventually dubai where he helped launch flywheels burj views studio

in 2016 toussaint was approached by flywheel competitor and fitness upstart peloton which hired him to be an instructor for its new cycling classes broadcast to the companys growing customer base of athome users

i was teaching 20 to 25 classes a week at flywheel toussaint said peloton said you can cut that down and get your word out to the people at a larger scale

at the time the world of athome fitness wasnt where it is today he added

since joining peloton and reaching thousands of users on his bike toussaints online fan base has grown dramatically his instagram account now has 105000 followers up from just 19000 two years ago according to data from the socialmedia analytics website social blade

the rate at which hes added new followers to his instagram account doubled in 2017 from the previous year  when he joined peloton  and then tripled in 2018 according to data from the socialvideo analytics firm tubular labs

as a fitness influencer who works out twice a day  whether its riding a bike or playing basketball  toussaint uses his socialmedia clout to promote peloton and other brands to his thousands of followers he recently formed a brand partnership with lebron james sports nutrition company ladder to endorse the companys supplement products

i try to stay away from the paidperpost he said i try to focus on establishing longterm relationships and longterm partnerships

toussaint promotes peloton apparel on instagram both by wearing its clothing in photos and directly linking to the companys ecommerce pages he also regularly reshares peloton members stories on his instagram responds to questions on twitter and sends updates to followers reminding them of when hes teaching classes ; havent started that workout routine yet cost and convenience are two of the most popular excuses people fall back on to explain their lack of exercise and we get it pricey gym memberships and boutique fitness classes  and the extra time it takes to trek there  can be enough to dissuade even the most committed among us from squeezing in fitness as often as wed like

but with the first and arguably most fitnessfocused month of the year behind us nows the time to get serious about making exercise a more frequent appearance in your daily routine

and luckily for those of us groaning at the thought of trekking through the snow to spin class fitness can be affordable fit within your schedule and possible within the comfort of your home by ordering a few select tools to your doorstep you can create a superaffordable and effective inhome gym that will give you a totalbody workout and have you well on your way to shaping up for warmer weather

here are the top picks of fitness professionals for equipment that will give you the biggest bang for not very much buck

gliders and sliding discs are great because they are about the size of a paper plate and you can use them on multiple different surfaces says vanessa huffman director of education for club pilates the gliders change your ground into an unstable surface which recruits the core and creates a huge stability challenge for your entire body most notably you will immediately feel your adductors inner thighs and under arms scream during most moves

brian bott certified functional strength coach founder of aspire fitness and coauthor of get with the program agrees that gliders are an extremely versatile tool that you can easily pack with you on the go and use to train every muscle in your body from lunges to mountain climbers and other various core exercises the sliders really up the difficulty of the movement you are performing says bott using the slider ensures that you keep proper form on the armlegcore thats doing the work and not overly relying on the leg or arm thats on the slider

if youre a beginner bott recommends not rolling all the way out instead set up near a wall and roll out until you hit it then as you get stronger continue to gradually move further away from the wall to increase the difficulty

this is possibly one of the only latenight infomercial products that actually works says bott the best part is that its super adjustable to any level the ab roller really targets and challenges the front side of your core

stretching and mobility work is often one of the most neglected parts of training but if you want to get results you have to train hard and if you want to train hard your body has to be able to move easily with a good range of motion to perform the exercises we want says bott

enter the stretch strap its used to enhance flexibility and range of motion so you can bend turn reach and stretch with greater freedom of movement says brad walker director of education at stretchlab an labased assisted stretching concept the stretch strap allows you to use the leverage of the strap to go a little deeper into the stretch position and take your flexibility to the next level it can also be used on any muscle group in the body so its a great stretch tool to compliment any workout whether its running swimming or working out in the gym

you may be thinking i can reach down and hold my toes for a minute without the use of a strap but this tool allows you to perform active isolated stretching which goes beyond your typical holdfor60second routine says bott instead you bring your joint to the furthest range of motion you can then use the strap to pull it just a little bit further while still actively trying to move the joint yourself says bott its a much more active process then simply holding a stretch for 60 seconds and weve seen it work a lot better with our clients

if youre up for the inhome workout but not quite sure what exactly to do flashcards can be a fun way to get reacquainted with popular exercises  and can also be a great way to get other family members or friends involved

these are a great idea to take with you when you travel as most of them are bodyweight based and you dont need any equipment says bott this can help keep you engaged in the workout because you dont know which card or exercise youll be doing next

the only drawback says bott is possible boredom once youve worked through the deck a few times after youre acquainted with the exercises up the intensity by seeing how many you can get through in a certain time frame or get creative and design your own quick morning workouts by arranging the cards in a different order each day you can also get decks made up of stretching and dumbbell exercises

for those without a lot of space and not wanting to get a huge set of dumbbells resistance bands offer a good alternative says bott you can get a few bands of varying resistance and come up with a fullbody workout

once you build up enough strength you will need to graduate to heavier weights but the bands do offer a unique training advantage over dumbbells says bott it makes the exercise harder towards the end of the movement which can challenge the muscle even more he says traditionally with dumbbells the weight is the same throughout the movement but as the band stretches even further its actually increasing the amount of resistance you are experiencing you can also get resistance bands with handles attached to more comfortably perform upper body exercises like bicep curls and tricep kickbacks

another neglected piece of training is what we call soft tissue work says bott think of it as a way to get your muscles to loosen up and fire better before working out we sit a lot so the muscles of the hips and upper back can get locked in those positions foam rolling is a good way to loosen them up a bit before stretching and make sure your body is performing at its best

you can use a foam roller to warm the body up before a workout or to cool down and recover after a workout which will help prevent stiff tight muscles the next day says walker the foam roller can be used on just about any muscle group although it works best on the large muscle groups like the quads and hamstrings the buttocks and calves and the chest shoulders and lats he adds

weve all seen the crossfitters at the gym swinging kettlebells around  but dont be intimidated the kettlebell is easily the biggest bang for your buck if you are looking to get in shape and invest in a home gym says bott they last forever and you can train every muscle in your body with them the kettlebell swing is also one of the most efficient fatburning exercises as well as a great toning exercise for your butt

light weighted 48 pound kettle bells are a great way to add resistance to momentumbased movements creating an unexpected impact on both the strength and cardiovascular elements of the workout adds huffman the weighted momentum movements force the muscles in the core to activate and stabilize to control the movement of the limbs this is a great amplifier for the free weight experience in addition kettle bells have an easier to hold handle that elicits a higher level of confidence so when your trainer asks you to rotate your long arm in a figure 8 motion you dont feel like your freshly lotioned hands will fling the weight across the room

some things never go out of style and when it comes to gym equipment the jump rope is one of them bott calls it one of the most underrated forms of exercise

the best thing about a jump rope is that it wont allow you to continue with bad form he says when running its very easy for motivated trainees to push to run further and longer at the expense of their form this is what leads to many common overuse injuries you see with running the jump rope however doesnt allow for this once you get tired and you arent maintaining the right posture youll mess up and be forced to rest

magic circles were invented by famous fitness guru joseph pilates the fun fact about them is that they were initially designed out of the metal from the outside casing of a beer keg says huffman

the circles have a dual purpose in that they can challenge the adductors inner thighs and under arms and abductors outer thighs and upper armsshoulders depending on how you are holding the circle because of this dual purpose some clients refer to the circle as the torture device which translates to its really good at turning up the volume on any move

no the trx suspension trainer doesnt fall under the 20 mark but if youre willing to splurge on a piece of equipment that will really take your workouts to the next level this is it youve likely seen these straps hanging around your gym and one of their big selling points is the ability to take them in house or outdoors or on the road due to their portability the trx is one of the best bang for your buck pieces of equipment for your home gym and even travel it hooks up easily and can even be mounted in a doorway if needed at home or on the road says bott

the equipment is a good investment for beginners and more advanced fitness enthusiasts alike one of the best benefits of the trx is that it makes modifying an exercise extremely easy whether you are a beginner or an advanced trainee the trx allows you to be in control of how hard you are working says bott take a squat or lunge for example for some beginners their bodyweight might be too much in the beginning by holding on to the trx they can provide themselves the stability and support needed to perform the movement at their level when performing a movement like a standing row the further you move your feet underneath the more difficult the exercise becomes so you can find just the right challenge for you

just how much of a challenge you ask a study published in the journal human movement science found that doing a suspended pushup using trx bands activated the abdominals 184 percent more than doing a standard pushup  youll definitely be getting your moneys worth trx also recently released its own take on a foam roller called the rocker ; a georgia planet fitness has given the boot to rapper boosie badazz after he recorded a video about the transgender child of basketball star dwyane wade inside the gym

while the rapper claims that he was banned over his comments planet fitness alleges that boosie failed to adhere to gym rules and was harassing club staff

boosie badazz  whose real name is torrence hatch jr  aired his grievances in a rambling instagram post thursday in which he said he was kicked out of a planet fitness club near atlanta

basketball player dwayne wade announced earlier this month that his 12yearold child who was born a boy is now a transgender girl named zaya boosie criticized wades announcement in an earlier instagram post in which he said the basketball star had gone too far

i gotta say something about this shit bro dwyane wade you gone too fucking far dawg the rapper said in the post that is a male a 12yearold at 12 they dont even know what they next meal goin be they dont have shit figured out yet he might meet a woman anything at 16 and fall in love with her but his dick be gone  how he gon  like bruh you going too far dawg ; spring texas  precinct 4 released bodycam video thursday of a suspect being chased on foot then shot several times outside an la fitness in spring

4yearold girl sexually assaulted in her front yard houston police say ; in the past gyms were giant warehouses of fitness where you could do everything from weightlifting to yoga now boutique gyms are popping up everywhere that focus on one kind of exercise theyre culty they sometimes tantalize with promises of weight loss and rapid gains and they want our money ultimately all of us exercise because it makes us feel good mentally and emotionally the uptick in niche gyms use research touting the benefits of group workouts but for many of us exercising is meditative and restorative  and that restoration needs to come when were totally and completely alone i talked to one of my favorite psychologists to find out whether exercising alone has mental health benefits

i have been running alone at sunrise for over 20 years at first it was out of embarrassment i was out of shape and i wanted to get fit without an audience but the habit has stuck even though i am now a bonafide fitness professional i have been a yoga teacher for almost 15 years i still prefer to do all my exercise alone yoga running going to the gym and skating its helped me learn to find an internal locus of control i have to be intimately connected to my own body to ascertain how much to push myself

i sometimes feel like an outlier though because people are always saying that working out in groups is better it helps them stay motivated  kind of like how you might study for a test with more focus if youre in the library with other people studying versus say your bedroom but thats othercentered motivation which isnt always as empowering as it seems

when you work out for yourself instead of for others youre treating yourself with respect says aimee daramus a chicagobased psychotherapist being thin is often something we do for other people while strength speed and the mental benefits of exercise are often things we do for ourselves when you exercise alone you have to figure out what your body wants from the inside out because theres no basis for comparison

also exercising alone has taught me a lot about the joy of solitude because i have run alone for such a long period of time i have come to associate being alone with the feelgood chemicals that exercise releases in the body when i run there is no sense of loneliness i am alone with endorphins and i get to focus on them thats basic classical conditioning daramus explains when i share my solorunning manifesto with her she doesnt mean physical conditioning but psychological youre associating something that feels good and releases powerful chemicals with being alone eventually that association made me comfortable doing other things solo as well  like watching movies or going out to dinner

and heres the thing about exercise and mental illness that gympushers dont get sometimes exercise can help immensely and for someone with anxiety or depression being around a lot of people is a huge deterrent there have been studies on depression showing that some people get positive results from running that equal those of antidepressants says daramus exercise releases endorphins very mild painkillers produced by the body that also give you a mood lift it also releases dopamine norepinephrine and serotonin all of which are also components in antidepressant medications she explains everyone deserves these natural uppers even if they dont want to see another human while doing it

there are some downsides to exercising alone of course sometimes i dont push myself as hard as i know i could daramus has some motivation hacks for folks who want to push their limits alone figure out what you really want and set goals she says make sure you educate yourself if you can get a few sessions with a personal trainer to teach you what good form feels like also being a solo workout junkie doesnt mean you have to work out alone all the time daramus suggests using events like marathons or meetups as ways to keep yourself working towards a goal

exercising alone inarguably gives you a sense of intrinsic reward the feeling you get when youre motivated by your internal satisfaction instead of a compliment or accolade from another people who place higher emphasis on intrinsic rewards rather than external ones tend to have a higher sense of selfesteem so many of us spend our lives pleasing our families and then teachers bosses and the irs that it can be an incredible relief to get in touch with what you actually want for yourself says daramus ; a man was killed in a driveby shooting friday afternoon feb 21 in the parking lot of a santa fe springs gym

the shooting was reported about 355 pm in front of a planet fitness gym at 11130 washington blvd said whittier police lt dominic iraldo

the shooter drove a white sedan and from the car fired at least once striking the victim once in the head iraldo said the car drove away east on washington bouelvard

paramedics transported the man to a hospital where he was pronounced dead

detectives have yet to determine a motive nor did they have a description of the suspected shooter

iraldo did not know whether the victim was a patron of the gym

authorities canvased the area for security camera footage that may have shown the shooting and found none iraldo said there were no known witnesses to the shooting

yellow crime scene tape enveloped the parking lot friday evening as detectives continued investigating the scene iraldo said

the investigation kept many who were working out inside the gym from accessing their cars according to a gym employee who answered the phone there friday night the employee declined to provide a name some patrons continued working out while others stood by the door waiting for police to clear the parking lot ; previous studies have concluded that people who suffer from social jetlag have a higher risk of heart disease depression and obesity

i loathe the sound of my alarm clock it makes absolutely no difference which sound i set it to ive tried everything my favorite song birdsong a relatively neutral ringing

i simply cannot stand the sound

im not a serial snooze buttonpusher nor am i the sort to leave a smartphone ringing for three minutes before getting up to switch it off there really is no sound i dread more than that of my alarm clock

im pretty confident im not the only one who feels that way i imagine many late risers who regularly have to get up early feel similarly

thats precisely why i want to know what its like to get up without an alarm clock in a normal working week

im doing this not just for fun but also because i want to prove something i wrote an article about how a year of getting up at seven in the morning from monday to friday an hour earlier than im used to had been bad for my health and had prompted people to write to me from all over the world  from new zealand to the netherlands

ill admit that some went to the effort of writing to me just to let me know how much of a whiny millennial i was but the majority seemed to feel the same people were saying their productivity was adversely impacted when they had to get up earlier

the good news is that were not imagining these problems theres a scientifically recognized phenomenon called social jetlag thats responsible for your symptoms

every human being has a body clock and everyones ticks differently

thats why some of us are early birds and some of us are night owls

if we constantly work against our body clock it can have negative health consequences

what happens when you finally listen to your body clock

my selftest was based on an experiment conducted by kenneth p wright from the university of colorado boulder in 2013

he took 13 participants to camp in the rocky mountains for a week

the aim of the study was not simply to get people out of their everyday lives and allow them to get up without an alarm it was also to minimize the influence of artificial light

wright came to the conclusion that the participants social jetlag saw an improvement after just one week and that their sleep rhythm had adapted to sunrise and sunset although i should probably start clarifying now that i didnt sleep in the forest for a week then go to work every morning

what i did was this

i warned my boss and colleagues i might be late for work in the morning but i assumed i wouldnt suddenly sleep past 11 the next morning

i usually get up at eight of a morning or so i thought when ive set my alarm after eight oclock in the past ive often woken up before the alarm has even started going off but then again maybe ive been wrong all along

i was in bed at 11 oclock at night and woke up on monday at 806 in the morning

when i arrived on time at nine that day a colleague asked me if id started my experiment when i said i had most couldnt believe it with some saying youre more punctual than you are getting up with an alarm clock

in truth i did cheat just a little i didnt quite rely on my body clock

when i awoke to the sight of bright sunlight in the morning i flinched and checked the clock

it said 705 so i turned over and dozed off for another hour i decided not to check the clock until i felt ready to get up

the first morning didnt go too well it turns out its just as hard to do without artificial light as it is to get up without an alarm clock

i just couldnt resist the temptation to turn on the light in my room in the evening

there are perks to steering clear of your smartphone or skipping tv in the evening you automatically go to sleep sooner because the artificial light doesnt keep you awake or perhaps you just fall asleep because you have nothing to do

our body follows a biological rhythm thats centered around daylight and this rhythm can vary from person to person  and even from animal to animal and plant to plant

there is hardly a single function in the body that isnt centered around the rhythm of the day our body clock regulates all of our internal processes  be it the concentration of calcium magnesium or potassium in the blood up or the presence of enzymes says till roennerberg professor at the lmu and considered one of the leading experts in the field of the human bodys internal clock

roenneberg distinguishes between two types of sleepers larks early risers and owls as the name suggests more nocturnal people in between which there are many varying degrees

on tuesday id gone to bed at 11 the night before and woke up at 803

i cheated but again it wasnt deliberate at halfpast seven i briefly woke up checked my watch and then dozed for another half an hour

i dont know why i kept waking up  i think it may have been fear of oversleeping and not turning up at the office until past 11

theres a simple reason for waking up without an alarm clock its healthier because the hormone melatonin regulates our bodys daynight rhythm

when the melatonin concentration in the blood rises in the evening we get tired when it dips again in the morning we wake up

the problem with alarm clocks is they often pull you out of sleep even though your bodys melatonin level isnt at a high enough level for you to wake up naturally thats why we often feel shattered all day long

of course its still only my second day of the no alarm clock routine but i feel uncannily fresh and awake tuesday is also my weekly barreworkout day its essentially a mixture of ballet and workout

at the end of the lesson we always do about 100 different forms of situps and two minutes of planks

normally im completely exhausted during the last set of exercises and can barely hold my arms up but my workout was easier than ever

the dance class ends at nine and i already know it wont be easy for me to fall asleep today  i usually have that problem when i do sports in the evening

on wednesday i woke up at eight exactly after going to bed the previous night at about 1130 prior to which id been awake for quite a while

id done it i hadnt looked at my watch in the morning i got up when i thought i felt rested and awake and only checked the time afterward

my colleagues say its possibly the most boring experiment of all time mostly as i wake up so consistently however this also confirms what id predicted eight oclock is my time and i need at least eight hours of sleep

to prep myself for the experiment i actually took part in a conference on chronobiology

chronobiology is the study of the internal clock and has been a serious subject for some time three scientists received the nobel prize for medicine in october 2017 for their research in chronobiology they succeeded in deciphering the genetic mechanisms that emanate from the internal clock of fruit flies

not only did i learn at the conference that we are more similar to fruit flies in terms of our internal clock than we think i also learned that the internal clock changes according to age older people sleep less and usually get up earlier and that it ticks a little differently in men and women our internal clock even determines how effective medicines work for us

after a day with scientists from lmu harvard and oxford i almost had the feeling that our whole life was ultimately determined by our inner clock those who permanently fight it are more susceptible to diseases

im so optimistic that ill be able to get up at eight oclock without an alarm for the rest of the week that i arranged to meet an ebay seller at nine in the morning the next day to pick up a vacuum cleaner

as it turns out i was a little too optimistic the day before i woke up at 848 after going to bed at midnight

when i made the appointment with the ebay seller i was unaware that i would end up in a cocktail bar with my colleagues later that evening

when i drink alcohol even if very little i sleep very poorly i only had a small beer and a gin and strawberry cocktail and yet there i was in bed lying awake until well past midnight

when i woke up in the morning i still assumed it was probably around eight oclock again but then came the shock it was 848 not only was that day the first i would get into work after nine i was also late to pick up the vacuum cleaner

i showered brushed my teeth got dressed and put on my makeup in less than 12 minutes im setting a personal record for that by the way

thankfully the seller wasnt in any hurry that morning and was waiting for me

on friday i went to bed at 1130 and woke up at 835 i slept a little longer than on the first days of my experiment but on fridays its not a big deal as i work from home

i feel now as though i have a pretty good idea of when im asleep in the morning and when its time to wake up when i opened my eyes in the morning i could sense it was about 830

maybe its also something to do with getting used to daylight in the room after five days ive noticed i barely felt tired during the week usually i find myself very lethargic after lunch or in the late afternoon and notice that i often have to yawn

the week left me feeling very rested every day and feeling tired around halfpast ten at night

i went to bed on friday night at about midnight and ended up waking up on saturday at 817

isnt that remarkable

even though its a saturday and i have the chance to sleep for as long as i want i feel totally rested and awake at 817  much to the chagrin of my boyfriend who had come home from a business trip on friday and probably would have liked a liein

this saturday im facetiming my family in austria my mother tells me  without knowing about my experiment  that i look very fresh and that the dark shadows under my eyes which i often have have almost disappeared

the fact that id been waking up almost every day at the same time  without an alarm clock  shows i have found my inner clock to some extent and it shows my current lifestyle fits well with my inner clock but of course this isnt always the case

in march researchers at the university of colorado published a study according to which people who frequently switch between day and night work are 40 percent more likely to develop type ii diabetes previous studies have concluded that people who suffer from social jetlag have a higher risk of heart disease depression and obesity

german researcher till roenneberg therefore advises companies to create working time models that fit their employees internal clock

on sunday i went to bed at 0055 and woke up at 938 id gone to the cinema for a late show meaning i went to bed later than usual the day before sunday was the only day that week i didnt wake up before nine

my week without an alarm clock had a definite effect on my fitness my boyfriend and i went to the mountains for lunch to go hiking we decided not to take an easy walk but to climb a summit of 1668 meters we managed to cover 580 meters or 170 floors according to my health app and i realized how easy everything was even the steepest passages i climbed with such ease that my boyfriend  who was just a little envious  was panting behind me id been hiking the previous week and had found hiking trails that were much flatter were much more difficult for me

i woke up at 540 in the morning after having slept at 2215 welcome back to reality being rudely awoken at that time to catch a train after the experiment id done now i remembered how terrible the sound of the alarm clock was

but its not just that i noticed how fatigued i was all day after having to get up so early its like the day is running away like a blurry film before my eyes im already looking forward to going back to bed in the morning yet when i go to sleep at night theres no salvation

luckily i already know i dont have to get up until eight the rest of the week the fact that this time matches my internal clock has been clearly demonstrated over the past week

i usually woke up naturally between eight and halfpast eight  even without an alarm clock and at the weekend when there was no compulsion to get up

of course till roenneberg and other experts in chronobiology would probably criticize me as my selftest would not be suitable for a scientific journal

i can only speak from my personal experience this week but its showed me im much fitter and more productive when i listen to my body clock ; featured_button_text 1 of 7

waterloo  irving physical education teacher cory arensdorf introduced his class of fifthgraders wednesday morning to a new twist on the old game of tag

its called food fat attack the healthy runners run from the fat attack taggers who wear jerseys adorned with names such as candy boy nacho dude and french fry girl they attempt to tag the healthy runners who then have to fill their jersey with balls simulating fat cells

how do you get rid of the fat cells one student asked to the delight of arensdorf exercise he shouted to a room full of smiles

the incorporation of mental and physical fitness into nearly all aspects of the daily routine has earned irving elementary statewide recognition as a twotime winner of the healthiest state k12 school award presented by healthpartners unitypoint health

they cant just be physical they have to feel good about who they are before they can learn the lessons of being healthy and taking care of themselves arensdorf said

with last years winnings of 5000 the school purchased heart monitors worn like a wrist watch they alert kids throughout the day if they have an increased heart rate unless theyre in gym class they go through the steps theyve learned to calm down including breathing exercises and mindfulness practices

its something that could be revolutionary with kids who have anxiety said irving principal frederick zach zimmerman

coupled with games such as saturated fat ball heartline dribble and nutrition hockey arensdorf keeps students focused on fitness

he doesnt just make games for fun he makes them about learning and having fun fifthgrader jakiyah porter said

nutrition and exercise themes can be seen throughout the school there are water bottle filling stations an urban garden and fruits and vegetables instead of sugary snacks with help from food corps and the black hawk health department last year the school launched its first color run 5k

we are looking to inspire zimmerman said being in a lowincome area if we can do it anyone can

the midshipman will be identified within 24 hours once the family has been notified the naval academy tweeted it said the midshipmans brigade staff and faculty have been notified and grief counselors are available to help no more information was immediately available the naval academy conducts physical readiness tests twice a year that includes the plank and pushups its mission is to develop midshipmen morally mentally and physically and to imbue them with the highest ideals of duty honor and loyalty it says on its website ; boosie badazz accused of transphobic tirade for telling dwyane wade he shouldnt allow his son to cut his dick off

rapper boosie badazz says he was kicked out of planet fitness for questioning why former nba star dwyane wade was celebrated by the media for announcing his 12yearold son was transgender

in an instagram post boosie remarked do not go to planet fitness they racist they haters they just put me out planet fitness for what i said about dwyane wade son

earlier this month wade received plaudits for an appearance on the ellen degeneres show during which he revealed that his 12yearold son zaire was now transgender going by the name zaya and using sheher pronouns

wade later claimed that his son decided on becoming transgender aged 3yearsold yes really

boosie initially responded to wade by pleading with him not to allow his son to cut his dick off

after the media framed this as a transphobic tirade life is already being made difficult for boosie

manager who was gay refused to let me n planet fitness because of my past actions on social media about gender etc said the rapper

good

how are we supposed to build a fair  tolerant society unless we all think exactly the same while vilifying  punishing those who dont

my voice is being silenced by free speechhating silicon valley behemoths who want me disappeared forever it is crucial that you support me ; boosie badazz seems to be having a tough time accepting the fact that there are hard lessons to grasp when you speak out openly and unprompted

the louisiana rapper shared his outrage on instagram over being turned away from a local planet fitness while he pulled away in his car

do not go to planet fitness they racist they haters they just put me out planet fitness for what i said about dwyane wade son boosie explained and they said i said in a video one of they employees was f   or some s   they got roaches in that b  h

his frustration is in reference to a disparaging rant he made about dwayne wade and gabrielle unions trans daughter zaya wade who over the last week allowed her parents to reveal that she identifies as a girl deading her birth name zion dwayne shared the news on ellen last week as he continues his press tour for his upcoming espn sports documentary xxxxx

so once zaya our 12yearold came home  first zion i dont know if everyone knows originally named zion born as a boy  came home and said hey so i want to talk to you guys i think going forward im ready to live my truth the retired nba star told tv host ellen degeneres and i want to be referenced as she and her i would love for you guys to call me zaya

the family later shared that zaya knew she was trans at threeyearsold and began asking family members to reference her with sheher pronouns over the summer

boosie was somehow triggered by zayas decision to live in her authentic truth a task many grown adults dont have the courage to muster and took to the internet to slam dwayne wade while also purposefully misgendering zaya however his viral video would have consequences which came in the form of the planet fitness manager who denied the rapper entry

he attributed his treatment to the managers alleged sexuality where he continued to be homophobic and vile in his argument

manager who was gay refused to let me n planet fitness because of my past actions on social media about gender etc he said

do not support planet fitness boosie continued they have roaches n they shower water dont get hot get out ya feelings lil b  

a spokesperson for planet fitness released a statement to people regarding the incident

planet fitness does not tolerate harassment or discrimination of any kind in this instance a guest was asked to leave after refusing to comply with gym policies and harassing club staff we are the home of the judgement free zone and as such we have policies in place to ensure that we maintain a nonintimidating welcoming environment for all of our members where everyone feels accepted

most people on the internet rejoiced in the lesson that boosie refuses to mind the business which pays him one day people will learn to keep their hate speech to themselves and while we live in a country which allows the freedom to say what you want theres always a karmic response to negative energy ; shattered glass and mangled gym equipment marked where an suv slammed into the planet fitness location in south philadelphia sunday night

people working out at a south philadelphia planet fitness location got quite the surprise sunday night when an suv slammed into the building narrowly missing people working out inside

the driver crashed into the planet fitness location in the quartermaster plaza shopping center near south 23 street and oregon avenue around 930 pm leaving shattered glass and mangled equipment and weights

we saw the smoke coming from the back walked up to the back and seen all the weights on the floor the window shattered the car inside the building customer kaytylin meeler said

luckily none of the 20 people of so working out inside was injured the driver was taken to the hospital for observation

photos and video from the aftermath show the aftermath as firefighters surrounded the suv as it sat among the free weights

gymgoers said the woman behind the wheel appeared to be driving erratically around a nearby wendys before she backed into the large gym window

crews boarded up the window and cleaned up the mess overnight so that the gym could reopen planet fitness confirmed the gym was ready for workouts monday morning

the local planet fitness franchisee is actively working with the philadelphia authorities in their investigation of this unfortunate accident and we are grateful to the local first responders who provided immediate assistance planet fitness senior public relations manager becky zirlen said ; with more than a million subscribers kent dad matt morsia is the uks number one fitness youtuber

in an exclusive interview with kentonline he tells of his meteoric rise from frustrated pe teacher to a social media phenomenon

when his wife started maternity leave matt morsia made a decision that would change their lives forever

he was dropping a day of work as a pe teacher at folkestone academy in order to focus more on his youtube channel

worried wife sarah put her head in her hands and asked are you sure what about your pension how are we going to afford to live

three years later  with 160 million views to his name  matt has long since quit the day job

his channel mattdoesfitness now has even more subscribers than joe wicks author of the bestselling lean in 15 books

the former university of kent student has become the uks number one fitness youtuber  and is ranked 14th in the world

last summer such was the demand for more videos that sarah quit her teaching job at hythe bay primary school to help her husband with the channel fulltime

in the last month alone it has had 24 million views boosted by collaborations with former worlds strongest man eddie hall

millions more tune in for matts unique sense of humour and the heartwarming family interactions with sarah and their adorable threeyearold son luca

matt who grew up in folkestone now earns more in a month than he did in a year as a teacher

he has contracts with five companies  including gymshark and myprotein  to promote their products

the 34yearold also has an app with 1000 people signed up for his personalised training programmes

so how did the former harvey grammar school pupil get to where he is today it certainly wasnt always his dream to be one of the worlds biggest vloggers

in 2011 he was ranked among the top three triple jumpers in the country  representing england internationally  and had his sights set on competing at the london olympics

but during training matt suffered a stress fracture in his spine and for six months was completely out of action

when he was finally able to get back in the gym  and with brazil 2016 a distant four years away  his new obsession became lifting weights

sat with matt in their kitchen sarah 34 says to her husband when you couldnt triple jump i knew you needed something to do

the reason i liked you anyway was because you had something you were passionate about

the couple married in 2012 and it was sarah who suggested matt start putting workouts on youtube

within a few videos i got hooked says matt

but i reckon i did it for three years with no income  four or five videos a week each one after a day at work

ultracompetitive matt became a powerlifter winning a silver medal in the european championships in 2016

the manmountain had to consume 6000 calories a day to maintain a bodyweight of 16st 5lb  and was able to bench press 180kg deadlift 320kg and squat 265kg

he was invited to powerlifting events and drew huge crowds to watch him in action

i thrive on it  its my dream he said im the biggest exhibitionist

one day he noticed eating challenges were trending on youtube so he made a video where he gobbled 10000 calories worth of pizza mcdonalds and donuts in a day getting hundreds of thousands of views

his record is devouring a gutbusting 25000 calories in 24 hours  a feat watched 58 million times

matt unsurprisingly is not a fan of diets and insists getting into shape is all about exercise building muscle mass and eating in moderation

as well as uploading videos matt started writing training programmes for followers

that started to generate actual revenue he says within a few months it was level with the school salary

i knew it was a bit risky but i decided to start dropping my teaching hours

matt was worried that if his hobby became his fulltime job then it wouldnt be as fun

but it was the best decision i ever made he says

my content was a million times better being able to travel and have time away

it would be cool to be the biggest youtuber in the world

over the past seven years matt has published an incredible 1400 videos  mostly filmed in kent

he records clips wherever and whenever he can which can sometimes perplex those unfamiliar with the art of vlogging

old people are so suspicious he says i have been thrown out of waitrose three times because i was filming

as well as regularly updating his 600000 instagram followers he uploads two videos to youtube every week

he puts maximum effort into every single one often working 18hour days to give his clips the best chance of going viral

any youtuber of my size would have a video editor but im a massive control freak he says

the fact that now its my job is sick i genuinely love doing it

the downtoearth couple admit the constant demands of youtube and instagram can be exhausting social media is a beast that never sleeps

but when the hard work pays off its incredibly rewarding

matt spent 13 hours editing his most successful video in which part he takes on the us navy seals fitness test with a fellow bodybuilder

it has now been watched 14 million times

unsurprisingly having gained 13 million subscribers strangers often recognise him and stop to say hello  even on a family holiday to the alps

in recent years other youtubers fame has propelled them onto tv with the likes of joe sugg and saffron barker starring on strictly come dancing

so with matts star rising what would he say if the bbc came calling

i would consider it because it would be so funny he says

more and more people now see youtube and social media as an alternative career path to the traditional 9 to 5

a recent survey revealed the most popular choice of profession for eight to 12yearolds in the uk is to become a vlogger

for those who want to try to make a living on youtube matts advice is to just start doing it

my first video was terrible he says i was filming in my bedroom on a borrowed camera

it will be awkward to start with but ive now done 1400 videos how many hours of practice is that

matts most watched video above has been viewed 14 million times

aside from making the videos 6ft 1in matt  who now weighs 14st 8lb with about 13 body fat  has to maintain his sculpted physique by training two hours a day five days a week at the gym

more often than not going to the gym is the last thing i want to do he admits im tired or sore but i know not going isnt an option

its my business the more i put in the more i get out of it you cant have a magic life where there is no stress

as a man obsessed with progression whats next for matt

ive cracked youtube he says

i thought one million subscribers was unattainable but within a few weeks of achieving it i was thinking about what comes next

it would be cool to be the biggest youtuber in the world

reflecting on how matts decision to quit the day job has turned out sarah adds it doesnt even seem real

there are a lot of times in life where you might choose the risky thing ; dunlap

an alton man was formally charged with the burglary of the cyclery and fitness center in alton that occurred early friday morning

the investigation resulted in the identification of a suspect in this incident and on friday afternoon alton officers made an arrest the madison county states attorneys office on monday charged david m dunlap 42 of alton with one count of burglary a second warrant was issued revoking dunlaps bond on an unrelated case both warrants were later signed by associate judge ron slemer and bail was set at 50000 for the burglary

dunlap was in custody monday evening at the alton jail

these charges as well as the statements made herein are based upon probable cause all defendants are presumed innocent unless found guilty ; tyson furys trainer admitted it would be impossible for the heavyweight to enter his rematch against deontay wilder 100 per cent fit

the gyspy king 31 challenges for wilders wbc title for a second time on saturday in las vegas

but heading into the clash rival promoter eddie hearn backed the bronze bomber 34 to retrain his belt having heard fury has suffered problems during training for the rematch

and trainer javan sugarhill steward  who replaced ben davison  did not argue the 6ft 9in switchhitter had an injuryfree preparation

sugarhill insisted any sportsman will suffer bumps while competing but backs fury to be able to overcome any prior issues to walk away heavyweight champion once again

he told behindthegloves whatever eddie says is true

i dont wanna argue with eddie hearn or anybody thats saying that tysons injured and stuff like that

with tyson he could be injured could be or maybe not nobody comes into a fight 100 per cent so thats just being honest

every fighter and not even fighters in every sport if you train hard everybody has some kind of an injury some kind of nick and thats just the truth

but they go on with it thats part of being a champion thats part of the game the sport game

you see the soccer players they fall down like their leg is broke they get up about 45 seconds later theyre back running full speed like it never happened  but im thinking they need a doctor they need to get carried out on an ambulance on a stretcher

they play with those injuries but still very competitive still scoring still doing what they have to do because theyve been training for this

theyve been going through and working at this sport with injuries their whole life thats what builds that person

fury  who has vowed to weigh close to 19st for the vegas rerun  revealed he suffered ankle and leg injuries earlier in his camp but assured the knocks have healed

he said unfortunately i hurt both legs and both ankles in the training camp

but its not going to affect me in the fight because that was at the beginning of cam

p it was an unnecessary accident but you know things happen ; london reuters  only a fraction of people who run do so because they love it and most are motivated by boosting their body image and improving their heart and mental health according to a global survey by the fitnesstracking app strava

strava which tracks the sports activity trends of some 50 million people in almost 200 countries surveyed 25000 runners and found that half of them say they either hate it or barely tolerate it while only 8 love it

but running is often connected with a sense of stability at a deeper level strava said in a report of the surveys findings runners described the need to run to maintain their sense of self and as a way to respond to adversity

theres a great realisation that to exercise the body also helps to exercise the mind  which is a muscle that needs just as much looking after as the other muscles said simon klima stravas global marketing director

and love it or hate it the vast majority of runners cited health as a primary motivator for getting out and clocking up the miles more than 80 said they started running to get healthier stronger or have more energy

in brazil 22 of amateur runners said theyd taken up the sport due to a health scare that compares with just 2 in the united states there almost half of respondents said building strength was a core motivator to run  and this was even higher  at 54  among us women

german runners were the most likely of the nations surveyed to cite body image as a reason to run  at 47  and in japan 15 say they run to combat feelings of anxiety and depression

klima sees this as a sign of the times with social media networks putting pressure on people for how they look its driving up the motivating factor of body image he said

the why we run survey  which included respondents from nine countries in north america south america asia and europe  showed how runners worldwide share many common traits

it clustered runners into five key types based on the benefits they value and the extent to which they race or run in social groups

they ranged from passionate runners who run in many social settings and reap the psychosocial benefits like accomplishment and happiness to mindful runners  who tend to run alone  to reluctant runners who rarely compete in races and perceive the fewest social or psychological benefits of all runner types ; england medics are growing increasingly concerned over the fitness of marcus rashford and have contacted manchester united to examine their medical reports over fears for his euro 2020 involvement

this season has been the strikers most prolific to date netting 19 goals in all competitions  including 14 in the top flight  yet injury has blighted his season and his participation before the end of the campaign looks at risk

rashfords most recent setback came during the clubs fa cup thirdround replay win over wolves in midjanuary where he tweaked his back and was forced off the pitch having only come on as a substitute in the second half

ole gunnar solskjaer offered a worrying update on the strikers fitness ahead of the clubs recent european involvement suggesting rashfords club season could be over as well as his euro 2020 involvement

he said i would hope hes playing this season but itll be touch and go towards the end i would hope he plays before then end of season but if hes not fit enough he wont go the the euros

as a result of the prognosis the daily mail have revealed that england doctors have asked to see uniteds medical reports on their star striker while also wanting to be updated on his progress as gareth southgate begins to formulate his plans for this summers tournament

it is however added in the report that rashford believes he will be fit in time with the englishman happy with how his rehabilitation has gone since his stress fracture yet solskjaer did call for patience insisting that it was important we dont rush him given the severity of the injury therefore rashford is a race against time to recover before the summer

southgate sees rashford as an integral part of his plans with the 22yearold striker netting four goals in just seven international outings last year

that said there are a number of other forward options who could take his place jadon sancho has been in immense form for borussia dortmund once again this term and can slot in on the left hand side of the attack if needs be

more likely though  should rashford not be fit in time  is that the three lions will line up with raheem sterling on the left with hopefully harry kane leading the line having recovered from a hamstring injury and sancho in the right forward slot ; its an understatement to say that milind soman is a fitness inspiration for all at 54 the actor is pushing people to stay fit in whatever surroundings they live in

physical training and fitness challenges like running a marathon have a positive impact on our mind as soon as you begin to exercise there is a change in the mindset we just need to create a regular habit and the results will surprise you good habits result in better concentration mindfulness and clarity of thought and purpose says the actor

unlike many fitness experts milind swears by maintaining a healthy body by staying out exercising in gyms with machines doesnt work for me im more of an outdoor person so for me it is more of trekking and endurance sports like running and swimming its not how far you can run or how much you can lift he says explaining his fitness routine which doesnt sound like a regime

milind saysi sit as little as possible i never take the lift road running for me is fun and a priority and i find time for it wherever i am i run as often as i can for as long as i can strength training for me consists of pullups whenever i see a bar or a threeminute circuit at home of planks

milind prefers to exercise outdoors even in a city as it gives him a feeling of revitalisation and positive engagement clarity and calmness of thought he saysshort term goals like running a marathon or finishing ironman are great but the ability to deal with life or the positive goals that youve chosen for yourself determine how fit you are for me the focus has always been on training my mind a healthy lifestyle and regular endurance challenges have helped me to live my life the way i want to

food habits too have changed for the actormodel who admits he had to let go of his favourite food items ive become more aware of the food i consume and the discipline to choose has come automatically at one time i used to be addicted to chocolate but choosing right became an unconscious habit and i lost the taste for it he says adding that one should be careful with their diet plans

milinds diet secrets

on the whole my idea of healthy eating is to opt for light easily digestible foods that keep me energetic my diet if it can be called that is based on concepts of less refined less processed and less packaged and a choice of food that my body and mind are comfortable with sometimes even traditional foods can be difficult to digest he adds

sharing what he eats all day the actor says i always start my day by having a handful of almonds along with a glass of lukewarm water almonds keep me energised as its a smart snack with the right balance of nutrients for breakfast i eat a lot of fruits may be a whole papaya half a watermelon some bananas and whatever else is in season this is followed by some rice wheat or ragi porridge with jaggery or sometimes an omelette for lunch i usually have dal khichdi with lots of vegetables beans peas pumpkin a mix of whatever is available in the local vegetable market sometimes i add sweet potatoes to it besides being delicious i am told that khichdi also increases the release of satiety hormones that help me feel fuller for dinner which is around 730pm a light meal with salads and rice with dal and vegetables works for me ; by exercising just for only a few minutes on a fitness machine installed at anand vihar railway station in delhi one can get a free entry to the station platform this comes as a bonus to the commuters even as the initiative gives a friendly boost to their fitness goals

union railway minister piyush goyal on friday shared a video on twitter where a teen can be seen exercising  by doing situps  for a few minutes in front of a machine installed at the delhi station

piyush goyal captioned the video as fitness along with saving a unique experiment has been done at delhis anand vihar railway station to encourage fitness now platform tickets can be taken free of charge after exercising in front of the machine installed here

in his earlier tweet piyush goyal had mentioned the use of the segway at goas madgaon railway station warn passengers about safety there

piyush goyal had then said that the segway allows the segway security forces to perform their work more efficiently with the help of technology

last year prime minister narendra modi had launched a nationwide fit india movement at indira gandhi stadium complex in new delhi to encourage people to inculcate physical activity and sports in their everyday lives a statement said ; with new exercises invented every week new gurus trending by the day and a fresh study that contradicts all the other ones released every time you think youre getting the hang of things its easy to think that fitness is confusing  but it isnt

the fundamentals stay the same and the science is pretty well agreed  so by simply arming yourself with a few basic facts you can step into any gym forewarned against whatever fresh nonsense the fitstagrammers are preaching these are the 10 biggest myths in fitness  exercise your synapses for a couple of minutes by memorising them and do your curls with confidence

yes theres something masochistically satisfying about limping your way down a flight of stairs the morning after a big legs workout but delayed onset muscle soreness  doms to its instabuddies  isnt actually a convincing indicator of progress its thought to be caused by microtears in muscle and tends to crop up when you do movements youre not used to when you deliberately slow down the eccentric or musclelengthening part of whatever move youre doing such as the downward bit of a squat or just do a ridiculous number of reps conversely then you can eliminate soreness almost entirely by keeping the reps low or doing moves that dont have an eccentric such as throws and sled pushes there is such a thing as painfree progress

there are two key ways to get stronger increasing the size of your individual muscle fibres and recruiting more of them to fire together when you need to use them the first is what bodybuilders aim to do but the second is what your body would do  automatically  if you had to lift a car off a loved one in sports where excess size is a negative it is what competitors teach themselves to do this is how female olympic weightlifters in the lighter weight categories can outlift larger men getting big requires specific targeted training including lots of volume and extra calories and protein  and it almost never happens by accident

this ones been popularised by modern fitness gurus who will fairly sensibly point out that weight isnt a true measure of progress as fluctuations in the amount of water being retained can lead to daytoday shifts in the numbers and putting on muscle can lead to the numbers going up while youre making progress in the right direction this doesnt mean you should toss away your scales entirely yes you have to understand that shortterm fluctuations are inevitable and dont represent changes in body fat says emma storeygordon the trainerowner of esg fitness but over time changes in scale weight are predictive of body fat even if you are also building muscle the rate at which you can lose fat will be much quicker than the rate at which you can build muscle dont become overreliant on them but scales can show whether youre moving in the right direction

actually its more like the opposite properly done squats will strengthen the stabiliser muscles around your knee joints safeguarding you against injury as well as making you a bit more capable of bounding up escalators as for running a 20year study conducted by stanford university found that consistent runners many of whom were well into their 70s by the time the research period ended showed a lower incidence of arthritis than nonrunners as they aged it also showed that runners have a lower risk of osteoarthritis and hip replacements suggesting that pounding pavements isnt actually as bad for you as advertised

while we all lived in the offline wilderness the myth persisted that you could for instance target the fat around your midriff by doing hundreds of situps that myth has been mostly wiped by the ubiquity of the internet but replaced by the more subtle halftruth that its possible to single out problem areas by thinking hormonally that since for instance the stress hormone cortisol causes bellyfat buildup a bit more sleep and a few sessions on the calm app should see your abs emerge and while this is technically sort of true deliberately messing with your hormones is tougher than advertised and not really advisable the truth is we all have stubborn fat areas that seem to take the longest to get lean says storeygordon there are various reasons for this  hormones and sex both play a role for instance these cant be easily changed so you cant really choose where you lose fat from dont give up though stubborn areas will get leaner alongside everything else patience is the key

crossfit and endless neontinted edmsoundtracked fitness classes have made rest a fourletter word in the fitness industry but constant movement for the sake of it could actually be hindering your gains not helping them for most people  especially beginners  periods of recovery between sets or intervals allows for higherintensity betterquality movement lower risk of injury and a greater training stimulus that is likely to lead to superior results says the performance and wellbeing coach george anderson or in other words if you push yourself for an hour straight youll be forced to lift lower weights go slower and generally put in less work than you might with some strategic downtime and the optimum varies  for fat loss anywhere from 15 to 60 seconds between sets is ideal but for strength you might spend five minutes preparing for ultraintense efforts

machines are not pointless but good technique is important as sparseandspartan gym spaces emphasising basic barbell movements have proliferated so too has the idea that using machines to train is at best inefficient at worst dangerous machines force your body into awkward overlinear movement patterns goes the theory  reducing the input from important stabiliser muscles and stopping you from moving naturally but while there is some truth to this not every machine is the enemy whether youre a timepoor techniquefree novice or a more advanced lifter machines can involve less setup allow more work and provide extra stimulus to isolated muscle groups says the trainer dan osman that said the leg press is no substitute for learning to squat properly

lets be honest youve never seen britains greatest living olympian sir steve redgrave dryheaving over the side of a crosstrainer it may be intuitive and burn some calories but thats all this outdated relic offers says dr cameron nichol the founder of rowingwod when done correctly the rowing machine uses 86 per cent of your muscles spanning nine major muscle groups the rower also works with the time you have  if you need a short horrible finisher a 500m sprint will leave you sucking air and burning fat while a more ponderous 10km feels almost meditative and the olympiclength 2km is a test of will as much as power

once the fourminute tabata  20 seconds of work and 10 seconds of rest repeated eight times  seemed the logical endpoint of the workoutshortening craze with claims that it could replace much longer training sessions while offering roughly the same benefits now it seems almost glacial with three two and oneminute workouts promising to harness highintensity interval trainings hiit mystical powers and leave you more time for candy crush the truth anything is better than nothing and its certainly possible to make some gains in whatever limited time you have but longer workouts have effects that no microworkout can mimic oh and by the way in the original tabata study the test subjects  who were professional cyclists  worked so intensely that some of them refused to countenance trying the protocol again if youre not doing that theres no guarantee it will work as advertised

is running better than lifting for longevity do you need the mobility yoga offers more than a really jacked set of quads is zumba just a waste of valuable time that you could spend boxercising whatever training style you experiment with youll find someone ready to argue that everything else is useless and stupid that you should stick with them or go home says dr michael banna this kind of absolutism risks deflating people by telling them that their efforts have been pointless the reality is any physical activity has health benefits the right type is the one that doesnt injure you make you sad or make you want to stop ideally your physical activity should include a mixture of cardio resistance and mobility work spread across the week  but do what you enjoy  guardian ; these gadgets have been donated to organizations working with lowincome vulnerable populations for use in nutrition and exercise programs

for many of us wearable gadgets that track steps heart rate and other health metrics are a novelty item to play around with for a few weeks after that they end up in a drawer to gather dust

lisa gualtieri an assistant professor at tufts medical school is asking consumers to send her their unwanted fitbits apple watches and other healthtracking gadgets her program called recycle health collects fitness trackers refurbishes them and shares them with underserved populations

recycle health which operates out of the medial school has already collected more than 5000 trackers and sent them to nonprofit organizations since it got its start in 2015 it has provided the wearables to homeless populations veterans senior homes intellectually disabled adults and others in low income communities

gualtieri got the idea when she was preparing a lecture for her students and saw a startling statistic surveys from the research firm gartner suggest that about 30 percent of smart watches and fitness trackers are abandoned gualtieri thought it was highly wasteful that these devices so often end up in landfills she also considered that perhaps they arent being used in the right ways

when the typical person walks into best buy and gets a fitbit on a whim thats a totally different experience than having the support of health coaches or others in the community who can help with sustained behavior change she said

thats particularly true suggests gualtieri for seniors who might need support removing the packaging and setting the devices up or for those who wouldnt be able to afford one on their own but are motivated to set goals for themselves with the encouragement from their communities ; a north texas fitness instructor is tackling teacher stress and burnout with a focus on health and mental wellness

a north texas fitness instructor is tackling teacher stress and burnout with a focus on health and mental wellness its a special fitness challenge for just teachers who want to destress outside of the classroom

will clewis is a former teacher now on a mission to make it happen and its something good

gonna try it one more time two claps two claps one clap and go ahh fitness expert clewis said to a class of teachers at adams elementary school in arlington

most teachers dont prioritize their health thats how it happened to me clewis said and thats how it happens to the majority of teachers

for five years will clewis taught 7th grade texas history

and from the time that i started after a couple of years i had gained like 50 pounds clewis said i was stressed out i didnt see my family there was unhealthy food everywhere and that kind of put me in a place that i didnt want to be

clewis started training and eventually opened his own gym nearly a decade ago with a mission to change lifestyles now his new focus is on the physical and mental health of teachers partnering with north texas schools to help destress stressed and burned out educators

his goal is to inspire true transformation not just quick change

most people have selfdoubt they dont believe in themselves they have dramatic pasts and those are the things that i really try to focus on clewis said

everyday there is a message surrounding growth positivity just really helping you become the best version of yourself said jalie morris an intervention specialist at fort worths dunbar high school

i think i realized i was really stressed out when i would be going to my car and just crying to be honest morris said my stress has improved tremendously to where when i go back the next day im really able to give kids my all and im not just giving them 50 or 75

everything starts with a vision and this was just an idea that i had clewis said

that vision is helping teachers perform better in the classroom and in their personal lives

i feel like my confidence has improved not only am i enjoying the improvements that i am seeing in my body but just kind of that mental growth morris said

clewis four week challenges for teachers is something hed like to keep going longterm he plans to continue to partner with north texas school districts to continue to destress stressed out teachers ; the cleveland browns were the biggest disappointment of the 2019 nfl season after a couple of big offseason acquisitions such as odell beckham jr and olivier vernon the browns were considered to be a super bowl favorite but instead fell flat with a 610 record

another bright spot for the browns quarterback baker mayfield took a step backwards in his sophomore campaign after throwing for 3725 yards 27 touchdowns and 14 interceptions in 14 games last year the former no 1 overall pick threw for 3827 yards 22 touchdowns and 21 interceptions in 2019 the browns still believe that hes the future of the franchise and they are focusing on his fitness this offseason

according to the nfl networks ian rapoport an important focus for the browns heading into 2020 is mayfields fitness and body makeup the 2017 hesiman trophy recipient reportedly put on some weight last year to bulk up and lost some of his quickness his plan is to be slimmer and faster this year with an emphasis on being in better shape

mayfield actually rushed for 10 more yards and three touchdowns in 2019 but did appear to be a tick slower compared to his first season

despite the disappointing year the browns still have all the pieces to make it back to the postseason for the first time since 2002 cleveland made the decision to fire freddie kitchens after just one season and replaced him with former minnesota vikings offensive coordinator kevin stefanski  who was actually the other finalist a year ago when kitchens was hired

stefanski who is now the third youngest head coach in the nfl is charged with unlocking this offense which has the potential to be one of the best in the league in 2020 a more fit mayfield will only help their cause ; shaqiri has not featured for the reds since january 11 due to a persistent calf issue  and there is currently no timeframe on a return for the no23

it seemed like quite the quick milestone for a startup that only recently entered an increasingly competitive digital fitness market and yet founder brynn putnam seems candidly unfazed by mirrors abrupt success and predictably arrogant about its future

robert allen tells global news he feels duped after paying 500 upfront for a twoforone membership for a whole year and then three months later the doors where shut

allen and his girlfriend thought they were starting the new year off right when they signed up for the gym close to their home in belmont ont just south of london

this was the closest gym to us other than that we would have to go to st thomas or up the 401 to get to another gym

on feb 6 a notice was posted on the clubs facebook page informing members that their memberships had been cancelled and that staff had not been notified before the closure

the directs any inquiries about refunds to abc financial but after weeks of calling allen feels he is no closer to getting his money back

he said abc financial told him that everything would be dealt with once the owner of the gym decided what to do

global news has reached out to abc financial for comment

on the evening prior to members being informed of the closure former trainer marcin pszczola said a bailiff entered the gym and told staff they had an hour to gather their things and get everyone out

it was just a complete shock he said i continued teaching the rest of my class in disbelief saying this is probably just a misunderstanding

pszczola said they tried contacting the owner to figure out what to do but no one was able to get a hold of him

he estimated 25 employees were working at the gym at the time who were suddenly out of work without notice

you put all this time into a certain place and its just goodbye without anything

pszczola who worked for the gym for 10 years wishes he and other staff were given notice so they had time to find other employment

the gym always had a good following and some dedicated and loyal members that were using it but i definitely did notice a decline

pszczola said he started to notice a drop in the quality of the gym especially during the last five months with a lot of things breaking and not being fixed

i was asking a lot of questions and i kept getting told the same answer  a guy is coming but the parts are on backorder i feel like its just something to say to cover things up

if the company has not filed bankruptcy the business is obligated to fill your order for goods and services or refund meidinger said

closing a business does not relieve the owner of the responsibility

meidinger said that if you have a copy of a receipt and it was paid for with a credit or debit card there may be an option to file with your bank or credit card company to dispute the transaction

credit cards sometimes offer more consumer protection on purchases then debit cards do so its generally better to do your shopping for bigticket items on credit

well mayfield is apparently listening to the critics and acknowledging that he gained weight last offseason in an effort to bulk up to improve his durability per nfl insider ian rapoport the oklahoma product will prioritize his fitness and body makeup this offseason

that was about as kindly and professional as rapoport could have summarized mayfields fitness levels this past season a photo emerged in late january that showed mayfield alongside a few new york giants players to say that the former no1 overall pick resembled anything but a professional athlete would perfectly encapsulate the comparison in physique between the players

were no bodybuilders but theres obviously a difference between being stocky and bulking up and the former no 1 overall pick is definitely personifying the former in that picture thats not us hating either even browns fans would admit that mayfields lack of muscle tone is glaring

it appears as though mayfields forgettable second year in the league served as a wakeup call for his and the browns sake lets hope he enters year 3 in much better shape ; with gym rats prepping their bods for warmer weather even suvs are hitting the gym

at least thats what happened at a planet fitness in south philadelphia on sunday night when gym goers were shocked after hearing what they initially thought was an explosion

according to nbc news a driver of an suv plowed into the planet fitness location in the quartermaster plaza shopping center near south 23rd street and oregon avenue around 930 pm

miraculously none of the approximately 2030 people inside the facility were injured

you can watch the cbs philly news report of the offroading incident here

witnesses who narrowly escaped the collision instantly shared footage from the wreckage with knockedover gym equipment and shattered glass

we saw the smoke coming from the back walked up to the back and seen all the weights on the floor the window shattered the car inside the building

all the dumbbells fell all the free wights so you hear boom boom boom boom boom and smoke

gym goers noticed that the woman  who was reportedly in her 40s  had been driving erratically by a nearby wendys before losing control and slamming into the building

people went over to her and asked her how she was she wasnt responding very well but she was ok at least physically like breathing and in that way

when the police came they just literally loaded her up put a neck brace on and rolled her out to the ambulance

eyewitness briana meelee added

people were checking on her but she really didnt say anything she was just sitting there staring

the woman was taken to penn presbyterian medical center where she was treated for nonlifethreatening injuries

gym goers either counted their blessings or missed seizing an opportunity

people also wondered if the gyms iconic lunk alarm  which sounds off when it detects someone obnoxiously dropping their dumbbells on the gym floor  blared in the wake of the suvs dramatic entrance

this user reminded people of the gyms famous mantra

teesside superslimmer dibsy is hoping to get back into the gym fulltime after being given the all clear from doctors

darren mcclintock hasnt been able to workout at full capacity since undergoing a cardioversion procedure last year to restore his normal heart rythm

he needed to lose 10 stone before doctors could perform the invasive surgery to correct his heart problems before he suffered a heart attack or stroke

thankfully the operation was a success but dibsy had to be put on medication for the following three months which limited the amount of exercise he could do

and those three months are now up

so on monday the pallister park lad underwent an ecg and other tests  and he got the news hed been hoping for

medical professionals gave him the allclear and as soon as the remnants of the medication are out of his system he can start hitting the gym once again  albeit at a slower pace

speaking of the good news dibsy told teesside live im absolutely over the moon im no longer on any medication but i am adhering to some guidelines

my main goal is get back to full fitness but the challenge is finding the right balance i dont need to be killing myself in the gym to lose 20st anymore im just easing back into it

its just a nice feeling to look at what me and mike have created

dibsy now has big plans which he hopes to give details on in the near future

his weightloss journey has also given him a new lease of life and he now hopes to give other people inspiration

if i can help other people that would be amazing he added

dibsy has come a long way since starting his healthkick with personal trainer mike hind

but as he continues to shed the pounds dibsys next battle is that of his excess skin which hes hoping to get fixed with surgery at some point in the near future ; a 33yearold man was arrested monday evening after allegedly sexually assaulting a woman in a fremont 24 hour fitness police said wednesday

in a recent product update wyze outlined its plans for the wyze lock outdoor camera scale and doorbell cam as well as the wyze band official information on the device is a little thin but zatznotfunny has unearthed more details on what we can expect as well as the usual activity tracking features and weather tools the band will let users control wyze devices straight from their wrist as well as any number of alexa devices thanks to builtin alexa capabilities smart phone notifications also appear to be included in the color screen device

it looks like launch is a few months away yet with wyze noting in its product update that it expects to complete the beta phase soon and move on to preparing for the ea launch no doubt the band  and indeed all of the products wyze hopes to roll out this year  will be a harder sell given its massive data breach last year that being said while there is no official pricing information available yet we can expect the wyze band to represent an affordable way of getting alexa on your wrist with the company no doubt mindful of its security levels and taking steps to tighten its operations that might be enough to convince customers to give it a go ; what started as a discussion during a fitness challenge has turned into marlboroughs first alcoholfree sauvignon blanc

better yet its only 106 calories per serving which is 85 per cent fewer calories then a regular glass of wine

the zero per cent alcohol sauvignon blanc was produced by giesen using grapes grown in marlborough

giesen chief winemaker nikolai st george said a workplace focus on health and wellbeing sparked the idea of producing the wine

 beer bragging thats light on the booze

 mighty ape defends online sales of alcoholfree beer

 how a decade of drinking changed the future of booze

the heineken zero per cent beer had just come out at the time we were doing a fit 24 challenge st george said

for the likes of someone like me i still need to have something in my hand and not feel like im missing out he said

so that sort of started the process and then 12 months later we were able to make a zero per cent wine a lot of that was because new technology had been brought into new zealand about six months ago

the wine was produced from using a spinning cone technology often used in perfume making

so you put a finished wine through this spinning cone and it passes through and then takes out the alcohol and the aroma st george said

once the alcohol is removed the aroma is added back into the wine

st george said a ripe vintage meant the batch of wine had strong citrus flavours

it came out a lot better than i was expecting in a lot of ways he said

theres a lot of citrus and a touch of gooseberry a bit more subtle aromatics of course it doesnt have the same full bodied texture but it still has a really winelike quality

having been through the process giesen hoped to make more zero alcohol wines this year

the batch isnt big at all its under 1000 cases it was a big thing for us to take the plunge

giesen 0  marlborough sauvignon blanc is available online now and will hit retail shelves in new zealand from march 2020 before being launched internationally later this year ; baltimore wjz  the baltimore city police department is using fitness as a tool to connect with innercity kids through an intense workout designed to break down the barriers

the band has features that are now expected from a basic fitness tracker according to zatz it offers a jogging app alarms weather step counter sleep tracker and heart rate sensor alexa can be triggered by a long press on the touchscreen where a sidemounted mic array will listen for your voice command the touchscreen also lets owners control wyze smart home devices to do things like toggle lights on and off or record a video from a wyze camera the band has a few customizable clock faces and backgrounds and appears capable of displaying smartphone notifications and fitness badges

theres no indication yet how much the band will cost though its expected to cost less than the alexaenabled fitbit versa 2 which offers similar functionality for 200 as noted by zatznotfunny theres no date for when consumers will be able to get their hands on it but wyze says in its product announcement that the band is in beta and it expects to begin preparing for an early access launch soon

for 2020 the wyze band will be joined by the wyze cam outdoor wyze person detection wyze scale wyze doorbell cam and the wyze lock according to a blog post by wyze cofounder dongsheng song only the lock is in early access the rest are in various stages of testing and development

one thing song doesnt mention in the blog post is the massive security breach the company experienced in december when an unsecured server exposed data from 24 million customers for about three weeks the company attributed the leak to an employee error ; cooper told insider shes always been passionate about fighting the ideal body type thats pushed on social media and helping women realize perfection doesnt exist

instagram fitness star sia cooper posted a series of edited pictures to her 11 million followers that emphasized the unrealistic beauty ideals women have been chasing forever

she showed what the perfect female body looked like throughout the decades from the roaring 20s to the postmodern beauty era of today

in her post cooper said the preferred body type in the 1920s was all about boyish

women even opted for short hair she said boobs and waists didnt matter and women felt liberated as they were

the hollywood era of the 1950s idealized marilyn monroes curves because society didnt care so much about weight cooper said but a slimmer waist was ideal

the swinging 60s and 70s was where the twig body style was introduced she said thanks to famous model twiggy so women wanted a thin and girly adolescent appearance

catwalks and supermodels became the ideal in the 80s with naomi campbell and cindy crawford

lean and tall legs and an athletic body type were ideal cooper said this was also when fitness started hitting big

this led onto the 90s which emphasized the androgynous look followed by postmodern beauty today where big boobs and butts and flat tummies are on the rise cooper said

women also turn to plastic surgery to achieve their desired look she said women are unhappier than ever with their appearance

cooper used to struggle with comparing herself to the celebrities and victorias secret models in magazines fronting the idea of what women wanted to look like she told insider this obsession with being thin led to her developing bulimia at age 14

today i find myself sometimes comparing but i stop myself in my tracks because i know better she said if you have social media chances are that you are or have dealt with it too

cooper said speaking about body image has been something shes always been passionate about and shes always fought the ideal body type thats constantly pushed on social media she has been openly outspoken against causes she cares about on her instagram such as excessive plastic surgery and momshaming

she said she wanted to open peoples eyes to how ridiculous our society has become expecting women to be thin with a big butt and full lips then flipflopping between favoring a super skinny physique or a curvier build every few years

i kept seeing the trend changing from thin back to thicker and back to thin again every 10 years or so she said

cooper added that trying to achieve perfection is damaging because it simply doesnt exist she was miserable when she was underweight at 105 lbs and wanted to keep losing weight to try and chase this ideal she was never going to reach

we are literally starving ourselves for the impossible she said even when you reach your goal weight you sometimes feel as if its not good enough

further dangers are diet pills diuretics and overexercising which all hurt your health  not to mention plastic surgery beauty procedures can help boost someones confidence in the short term but the effect can soon start to wear off if it was just a quick fix solution to be effective surgery has to be a decision thats made as part of a long journey to build selflove

cooper had her breast implants removed over a year ago due to breast implant illness she went under the knife initially to give her selfesteem a boost  something she now regrets

we need to learn to accept and cope the healthy ways such as balance a good diet with fats proteins and carbs and aiming for 30 minutes of activity a day she said no pills or niptucks needed

thats the motto of a new womens fitness center in littleton called camp missfits which offers mental and physical fitness to everyday women of all ages and walks of life a warning to gym goes however if youre looking to see super models and yoga shorts  you might want to find another gym to go to

its regular gals like me said rabbi kim jones its not like your typical gym

we have grandmas we have students moms stayathome moms working moms career moms said missfits owner priscilla freed

freed came to denver from the bay area 14 years ago to enter the denver seminary but life had other plans

god hit me over the head with a divine frying pan and said if helping women with their health and wellbeing and their emotional health isnt ministry which is serving others than what is she said

freeds program combines pilates weights and pulleys with spiritual growth and empowerment thrown in the mix

her 100 clients range in age from 20 to 81 years of age

we dig into the psychology and the emotions behind what lead to the weight gain said freed

all clients are women  regular women  freed said adding supermodels and instagram influences need not apply

we really want to target the everyday woman who really just wants to feel better no booty shorts no said freed

that philosophy resonated with rabbi kim jones who dreaded going to her old gym and feeling judged by strangers

all those really thin people and youre the only chubby one said jones

jones joined camp missfits two years ago and has never looked back

no matter how you look youre just accepted here thats why i love it so much i get to be myself i just feel so comfortable here she said

freed started the program in 2006 and trained a handful of clients wherever and whenever she could but the road hasnt been easy

man i was in homes and parks and backyards and alleys she told denver7

that worked until a colorado summer storm blew in and threatened to harm one of her only clients

she was holding a barbell and her hair started standing up and im like drop the barbell and we ran underneath a pavillion freed said she was holding a lightning rod basically

researchers have long associated menopause with an increased risk for cardiovascular disease also called heart disease the condition is the leading cause of death around the world in the us cardiovascular disease accounts for at least one in every four deaths each year women in particular face a greater risk after menopause mortality rates from heart disease and stroke are higher than breast cancer and other major causes of death combined experts have linked the decline in estrogen levels as a possible factor in the increased risk for cardiovascular disease beyond its function as the primary female sex hormone estrogen also stimulates the production of nitric oxide no while many cells in the body produce it nitric oxide produced by the endothelial cells in the walls of the blood vessels communicates with smooth muscle cells which causes them to relax this process called vasodilation is essential for many body functions like regulating blood pressure maintaining erections for men and more

while many studies suggest adding more nitraterich foods to help with vasodilation the researchers noted that these were often designed to either improve performance in athletes or look at its effect on patients of a specific disease for this study they focused on whether eating highnitrate greens can boost cardiovascular fitness in postmenopausal women ten women took part in the trial where researchers asked them to eat a serving of a leafy green salad every day for 10 days the salad treatment was done twice with a twoweek washout period in between

the findings revealed that the women who ate the leafy green salad had more nitratenitrite concentration a biomarker for vasodilation compared to the control group who ate canned vegetables in addition researchers noted better flowmediation dilation which indicates the production of nitric oxide by endothelial cells related another huge benefit of sunshine exposure nitric oxide production boosts cardiovascular health

these data suggest that daily ingestion of nitraterich leafy green salads may prove a useful strategy for improving cardiovascular health in postmenopausal women the researchers concluded in their report

emily skye an australian trainer and fitness influencer is known for inspiring body transformations both her own after her first pregnancy and the countless other beforeandafters she shares from followers and clients who adhere to her workout and meal plans

now shes sharing another kind of sidebyside  that of her own body when 19 weeks pregnant with her first baby contrasted with her body 19 weeks pregnant with her second child

during her first pregnancy the 19week mark introduced a slight bump with many of her stomach muscles still looking taut but at that same point the second time around her belly was bigger and rounder something skye emphasized doesnt matter so long as she and her future baby are healthy

every pregnancy is different she wrote just like our bodies lives fitness journeys etc we are all different and comparing is pointless unless its just for fun or out of curiosity  just dont let it steal your joy

i have to say how amazing is the female body she added us women rock dont we

many of skyes fans and followers could relate and applauded skye for celebrating the ability of a womans body to support and carry a future human being rather than to get caught up in comparisons

yesss i swear with each pregnancy i grew too our bodies are amazing and remembers commented sia cooper also a trainer influencer and mom known for her company diary of a fit mommy

i think people forget that every time you have another baby your body becomes better at getting into position and relaxing due to the previous trauma i was a lot smaller during baby 1 than baby 2 as well keep shinning babe added another trainer influencer and mom chontel duncan

always first baby vs subsequent babies its just that stretched out balloon of a uterus you cant do anything about it so people are crazy if they think its anything else i always joke that the size i was with my first at 9mo was the size i was when i peed on the stick for my second lol the difference is pretty funny a follower who goes by mel chimed in

our bodies are amazing and you are beautiful she added

dr stephanie ros an obgyn and maternalfetal medicine specialist at the university of south florida morsani college of medicine told insider skye and other womens experience of showing sooner the second time around is totally normal

as some of the commenters alluded this is because the stomach muscles and tissues around them get stretched out during the first pregnancies then in future pregnancies it doesnt take much pressure to get those tissues to allow the growing uterus to push forward ros said

she added that women may also find their baby bump sinks lower after the first pregnancy since the pelvic muscles are looser too in all this ends up making it so each pregnancy looks very different on the same person ros said

a second pregnancy or any pregnancy after the first may also look bigger sooner because the future child actually is bigger which is common for second children clare herbert a midwife wrote for the website the babycentre

its also possible for women to look bigger because theyre actually further along than they think they are herbert added especially if they were still breastfeeding when they became pregnant thats because breastfeeding can interrupt the menstrual cycle making tracking when the pregnancy occurred more prone to error

so long as pregnant women are seeing a doctor regularly however any abnormalities reflected in the belly size like excess fluid twins or a miscalculated due date can be detected ; shane adams successfully combined two of his longtime passions  fitness and working in a meaningful fulfilling career  when he joined orangetheory fitness in 2013 i had been working in the corporate environment since graduating from college adams says i enjoyed my job but never felt like there was much meaning in what i was doing i was ready to wake up every day and have a positive impact on the world

when adams and his partner opened the areas first location of orangetheory fitness in plano in 2013 a second and third location quickly followed at that time the orangetheory brand was in its infancy as area developers it was up to them to make it work we got in very early and by our third location learned we had something pretty special here adams says we decided we were going to open as many individual locations as we could under our own corporate umbrella

in total 14 members of the nmpa ended up suing peloton last year over claims that it used more than 2000 songs without a license those songs allegedly included tracks from lady gaga ed sheeran justin timberlake st vincent and many more and were said to be used in one or more fitness videos over the preceding three years peloton later countersued on antitrust grounds but the case was dismissed

he now wants people at large to put a premium on fitness and wellness

that is the need of the hour the 37yearold the brainchild behind the abhinav bindra targeting performance abtp told pti in a telephonic interview

the work that i have been doing revolved around prevention of injuries proper rehabilitation it revolved around well being and holistic approach the champion shooter added

daivam wellness indias first functional medicine centre has tied up with bindras abtp and asked about the collaboration he said this happened because of similar visions

it is very similar to what daivam really does like lifestyle  going to the route cause of the problem the philosophy is same

it is really the need of the hour what the people in the country need is meeting of minds between similar philosophy for betterment and well being of people

he is trying to ensure the best global practices in either prevention of injuries or treatment of injuries are accessible to the people at large

sport is always the inspiration behind what we do we do a lot of work on prevention of injuries lifestyle related issues which has resulted in a lot of structural imbalances and the technology that we have allows us to make everything much more accountable and completely data driven said bindra

only a fraction of people who run do so because they love it and most are motivated by boosting their body image and improving their heart and mental health according to a global survey by the fitnesstracking app strava

strava which tracks the sports activity trends of some 50 million people in almost 200 countries surveyed 25000 runners and found that half of them say they either hate it or barely tolerate it while only 8 percent love it

but running is often connected with a sense of stability at a deeper level strava said in a report of the surveys findings runners described the need to run to maintain their sense of self and as a way to respond to adversity

theres a great realisation that to exercise the body also helps to exercise the mind  which is a muscle that needs just as much looking after as the other muscles said simon klima stravas global marketing director

and love it or hate it the vast majority of runners cited health as a primary motivator for getting out and clocking up the miles more than 80 percent said they started running to get healthier stronger or have more energy

in brazil 22 percent of amateur runners said theyd taken up the sport due to a health scare that compares with just 2 percent in the united states there almost half of respondents said building strength was a core motivator to run  and this was even higher  at 54 percent  among us women

german runners were the most likely of the nations surveyed to cite body image as a reason to run  at 47 percent  and in japan 15 percent say they run to combat feelings of anxiety and depression

klima sees this as a sign of the times with social media networks putting pressure on people for how they look its driving up the motivating factor of body image he said

the why we run survey  which included respondents from nine countries in north america south america asia and europe  showed how runners worldwide share many common traits

it clustered runners into five key types based on the benefits they value and the extent to which they race or run in social groups

they ranged from passionate runners who run in many social settings and reap the psychosocial benefits like accomplishment and happiness to mindful runners  who tend to run alone  to reluctant runners who rarely compete in races and perceive the fewest social or psychological benefits of all runner types ; chat with us in facebook messenger find out whats happening in the world as it unfolds

cnnpushups curlups and the dreaded onemile run are a staple of childhood in us schools but california may put a stop to the tests

california governor gavin newsom has proposed suspending the physical fitness tests at the states schools over concerns that they promote bullying and body discrimination under current state requirements students in grades five seven and nine are required to take a physical fitness test which includes the onemile run curlups pushups and a measure of body mass index while the administration argues the physical assessments can cause students of different body shapes to be bodyshamed or bullied the bmi screening is particularly sensitive because it asks students to select whether they are female or male a number of school districts have complained to the state that this is discriminatory against students who identify as nonbinary according to hd palmer spokesman for the finance department read moreif the proposal which was included in newsoms budget bill for next year passes physical fitness testing would be suspended for three years dispelling myths breaking down stereotypes and improving school climate is one way california is working to keep all students safe and healthy consistent with the governors commitment to a california that respects all students palmer said in an email during the proposed threeyear suspension the department of education would consult with experts on fitness physical education gender identity and students with disabilities to determine whether the test needs to be modified or a new assessment should be developedthe proposal comes as californias annual reports of the fitness test since the 20142015 school year show a decline in the percentage of students scoring healthy the share of students meeting the healthy fitness zone for all six fitness standards aerobic capacity body composition abdominal strength trunk extension strength and upper body strength decreased by 33 percentage points for fifth graders 43 points for seventh graders and 46 points for ninth gradersbut palmer says newsoms proposal will not affect students physical fitness the pause in administering tests wont affect the amount or level of physical education that kids receive from their school palmer said adding that pe classes would still be a graduation requirement gender identity advocates praise the moveadvocates for gender identity are praising newsoms proposal as a step forward there is an objective in measuring a students fitness the problem is when its defined by gender joel baum senior director for professional development at gender spectrum told cnn the current fitness test sets different criteria for boys and girls for example a 12yearold girl is considered healthy if she can do more than four modified pullups but a boy of the same age is considered healthy if he can do more than seven pullups according to fitnessgram this difference in standards can put transgender and nonbinary students in a tough spot possibly even in danger baum said if im a transgender boy and nobody knows and then i dont meet the standards of a boy physically im put in a difficult situation either i dont meet the standards and take the according grade or i compromise my own privacy and tell my teacher i was actually born as a girl baum said adding that this can lead to bullying of the transgender student when a student who identifies as nonbinary is pushed to select male or female on the bmi assessment baum says that forces them to claim an identity thats not their own its simply important that kids feel seen by the school that they go to baum said by recognizing nonbinary people and using the right pronouns thats a huge acknowledgment of someones reality and experience and its affirming bmi isnt even an accurate measure of fitness some saybmi is commonly used in the us to measure obesity you divide your weight in pounds by your height in inches squared and multiply that number by 703 if the resulting number is 30 or higher a person is considered obese but in recent years bmi has come under scrutiny because it doesnt distinguish between fat and muscle which can be an issue for athletic people even former california governor arnold schwarzenegger would be considered obese when he won the top bodybuilding title of mr olympia in 1974 schwarzeneggers spokesman told the associated press whether the state uses fitness tests or not governor schwarzenegger believes that the most important thing is that our students have access to daily physical education classes to promote a healthy and fit lifestyle schwarzeneggers the spokesman said ; a search of exercise apps in the itunes store gets thousands of results  be it hiit running dance or more niche categories like prenatal fitness belly dancing or office yoga tech has made working out a more personalized and convenient experience giving users the boutique fitness studio experience from their living rooms the rapidly growing market grew 330 between 2014 and 2017 and is expected to reach 27 billion by 2022

and yet so many of these apps follow the same aesthetic formula a mirroredwall studio with hardwood floors harsh fluorescent lighting and uninspiring decor maybe theres a medicine ball sometimes a barre

nothing really grabs you and makes you excited to work out says entrepreneur mark mullett a former talent agent who found the available options rather uninspiring if you look at the fitness landscape you quickly realize you cant really tell the difference between an athome fitness video from 1993 2003 2013 or today

in may 2018 mullett and fellow creative artists agency caa alum ashley mills launched the brooklynbased obé an acronym for our body electric the livestreaming and ondemand fitness platform offers a more designcentric experience with a focus on lighting setting even fashion for a 27 monthly subscription users access 14 daily classes each boasting a color wheel of pastel and neon colors against a minimalist background it feels like a mix between a jane fonda workout and the movie tron with a dash of drakes hotline bling video

our customer wants something different explains mullett of his mostly millennial audience she wants something that that feels branded that feels specialthat evokes joy

like many angelenos mullett and mills were obsessed with boutique fitness studios the two caa colleagues routinely found themselves dissecting everything about the la exercise scene whose class did you take what was the atmosphere what music did they play how was the instructor ; lungi ngidi has lost probably four or five kilograms and some of his youthful spark after spending three weeks at a csa strength and conditioning camp intended to give him and three others time to work on their fitness

ngidi was sent to the camp on the back of a hamstring injury sustained in the first week of december in the mzansi super league and has emerged from it lighter leaner and ready for a leadership role in the upcoming odi series against england

in the absence of kagiso rabada who is being rested and dale steyn or chris morris who were not considered for this series ngidi is the most experienced frontline seamer in the attack only allrounder andile phehlukwayo has more odi caps which means ngidi will be tasked with spearheading the pack

that reality combined with the lifestyle changes he has had to make in a bid to have an injuryfree run may explain why ngidi had his gameface and not his usual grin on ahead of his first training session with the national side on sunday

to be leading the attack doesnt feel any different ive done it before ngidi said trying to play down the responsibility that lies ahead in the next week there is always expectation playing for the national side i am pretty used to that

what he is less used to is the rigorous routine he was put through at the high performance centre which included everything from fitness to food

you speak to dieticians work with strength and conditioning coaches and try find the best way to lose weight and to maintain strength and fitness ngidi said there is a lot that goes into it behind the scenes youve got to limit a lot more things that are harmful to your body

the guidance on how to live like an elite athlete was provided by adrian le roux a sports scientist who has worked with the indian south african and kolkata knight riders teams and who was put in charge of the recently completed camp in attendance was ngidi tabraiz shamsi jonjon smuts and sisanda magala

consider those names and their frames and the fact that smuts was withdrawn from the t20 tour of india and magala is unavailable to play in this england odi series because both failed to pass fitness tests and you will understand the company ngidi was considered part of

while not necessarily overweight the frequency of ngidis injuries was cause for concern since his international debut in 2017 ngidi has missed matches and entire series because of hip abdomen knee and hamstring injuries and has battled a stress fracture and a side strain he is only 23 so the wearandtear that comes with age is unlikely to be affecting him yet so what is the reason

its hard to pinpoint ngidi said we do a lot of work as national players but everyones formula is different and every person is different im a bit bigger than the other guys to it probably takes a bit more out of my body to try and bowl ive got to get the formula right

ngidi believes he has found a way to stay fit in shorter formats which is why making a comeback for the whiteball leg of the england tour rather than during the tests is ideal

the format we are playing now doesnt require long spells he said ive got my formula in the shorter format ive got that nailed down its just trying to find that formula for the longer format

whether that means south africa will need to be more selective about ngidis workload management in future will only be known later in the year for now its about getting ngidi on the park especially as he last played at international level three months ago and watched the england tests series from the sidelines knowing his presence could have made a difference

its always frustrating to be watching especially if we are not doing as well as we wanted to be doing he said from the side a bit of frustration but the test series is gone now weve got to focus on the onedayers

with the fiftyover world cup three years away and much rebuilding to be done before then south africas approach to odis may appear to be experimental they head into this series with a new captain quinton de kock four uncapped players fast bowler lutho sipamla leftarm spinner bjorn fortuin and batsmen janneman malan and kyle verreynne and an inexperienced attack beuran hendricks the other seamer in the squad has played just four odis leaving it to ngidi to lead the attack

he spoke like someone ready to do it gone were the giggles of a boy just out of his teens already living his dreams and in front of us was ngidi 20 a man of maturity who would not even reveal which english wickets he would most value taking

i would like all of them he said barely cracking a smile to win this series would be a massive step for us having not done as well as we would have wanted in the test series its a chance for us to redeem ourselves

and a bigger chance for ngidi and his teammates from the strength and conditioning camp to do the same ; lunges with a floor sweeper squats with laundry detergent bottles just weeks before her wedding youtube fitness guru emi wong released an instagram video during the coronavirus outbreak with a healthy reminder for her 16 million subscribers keep both hygiene and immune system up read the captions on her video showing that cleaning and exercises can go hand in hand

many people in hong kong are working from home and avoiding crowds to reduce the likelihood of infection but being homebound can be boring as wongs followers have complained even as she was counting down the days to her private wedding in thailand to chad the certified personal trainer posted this clip time is not an excuse any more instead of lying around and watching tv get up and get your endorphins going

not everyone has the luxury of both time and money to spend hours in the gym every single day but a lot of my workout videos are 10 to 20 minutes and anyone can do them at home wong says to explain her channels popularity

wong tied the knot in a lavish but lowkey ceremony in phuket early this week despite the odds against it going ahead she wasnt always the picture of health that shines through in her videos though wong underwent a lifestyle transformation that led to her online success

while studying international business and global management at the university of hong kong and for years after she graduated in 2013 wong was a hard partying girl drinking herself into unconsciousness three or four times a week living by the yolo you only live once motto i knew it wasnt healthy but i didnt care recalls the 28yearold wong also battled bulimia an eating disorder characterised by bingeing and selfinduced vomiting

view this post on instagram tag a friend who is bored at home lets clean and workout keep both hygiene and immune system up tag 一個覺得係屋企好悶嘅朋友 一舉兩得 a post shared by emi wong 王艾米 emiwong_ on feb 6 2020 at 500am pst

a health crisis commonly prompts a reexamination of ones lifestyle as it did for wong about a year after graduation she had her appendix removed but complications arose postsurgery stomach cramps especially after meals led to hospital visits i had to be very careful about my eating i had to stop drinking at the time thats when i first realised my health is not guaranteed she recalls

in her early 20s seeing other peoples beforeandafter fitness transformation posts on instagram inspired wong to exercise more she yearned for toned abs i thought i just needed to exercise so i could lose weight she says but it spiralled into an unhealthy obsession she exercised excessively  two or three times a day

while employed at an alcoholic drinks company at business dinners she was hyper aware of fattening food on her plate i would see sauce on pieces of chicken  to get rid of the sauce i washed the chicken in a bowl of hot water she recalls then she reached a low point where she vomited after eating almost daily for months i thought i was being really smart  but i knew from the media this wasnt a good thing she said about her secretive practice

the turning point came after a valentines day buffet she binged on french fries then purged them when her thenboyfriend chad now her husband asked why she had spent so long in the bathroom she told him the truth  all of it when he said one day i could get cancer i got really scared she recalls adding that this eventually brought the purging to a halt

research suggests chronic vomiting and the acid damage it causes to the oesophagus lining may lead to barretts oesophagus a condition considered a risk factor for cancer a study published in cancer epidemiology found patients with a history of being hospitalised for an eating disorder have a sixfold risk of oesophageal cancer university of edinburgh researchers based this on a review of hospital cancer and mortality records in scotland from 1981 and 2012 for 3617 individuals admitted to a hospital for an eating disorder the authors noted other cancer risk factors in these patients to explain the results such as their higher than average rates of being hospitalised for alcohol and smokingrelated conditions

wong kept a promise to chad to inform him every time she purged after meals he would remind her of the health consequences that slowly took effect i did it less and less to the point i stopped she said

when youre young you think youre on top of the world and can do anything you want says wong but youth fades and health problems will arise depending on your actions early in life

cadence pushups and planks will be required when prospective navy and marine corps officers take their biannual fitness test on saturday midshipmen have been testing the new exercises in physical training courses and other venues for about a year and members of the academys class of 2023 took the fall prt using cadence pushups and planks

in november the naval academy announced in an official instruction from the athletic director that the exercises would officially be added to the prt

now instead of cranking out as many pushups as possible during the test midshipmen will perform the exercise in time with a twosecond cadence a statement about the changes provided to militarycom says

this allows for a maximum of 60 pushups and provides a more accurate picture of a midshipmans leading edge of physical education in the navy it adds the cadence is included to ensure that all participants perform to the same standards

the academy is also adopting the plank in place of the crunches ahead of navy plans to make the same change midshipmen will be required to hold a frontplank exercise for as long as possible during saturdays test that exercise replaces curlups or situps which officials said can cause injury if done repeatedly

navy leaders announced in may that situps would no longer be used on the physical readiness test the service is currently studying how that event will be scored on the revised test which is expected to be adopted this year

related navys fitness test overhaul enters next phase

cmdr joseph jody smotherman deputy director of physical education at the naval academy said in a statement that the school wants midshipmen to be the leading edge of physical education in the navy

at the naval academy as initial entry training the prt is an internal process so we can make these changes before the rest of the fleet he said

its not immediately clear whether the navy will follow the academys switch to cadence pushups

lt cmdr martin wright human performance lab director at the naval academy said the exercise done with a cadence has been shown to be a more valid test for upper body muscular endurance

through numerous trials with various participants we found that the cadence greatly improved form and standardized a more complete movement through the full range of motion he said in a statement

men must complete 60 cadence pushups to get the full 100 points on that event women need 45 or more to earn full marks

the lowest passing score midshipmen can earn on that event is 60 points which men will get if they complete 35 cadence pushups and women if they do 20

scores for planks are the same for male and female midshipmen to earn the full 100 points on the event they must hold the move for four minutes and 20 seconds the lowest passing score they can earn is 60 points if they hold a plank for one minute and 45 seconds

shoes will be used during both the cadence pushups and plank portions of the test

during cadence pushups the midshipmans test partner will remove their right shoe and place it instepdown with toes facing toward their partners nose directly between the participants hands in parallel with the participants body

during the plank the shoe is placed underneath the midshipmans knees perpendicular to their body according to the test instructions

the shoe is meant to facilitate a more objective test and make sure the exercises are being done properly midshipmen should lower their body until their chest touches the shoe during the pushup portion of the test during the plank the midshipmans body cant touch the shoe

midshipmen also must complete a 15mile run as part of the naval academys physical readiness test ; the official opposition has withdrawn its motion calling for an inquiry into the fitness of public protector busisiwe mkhwebane only to submit afresh another

now grit bxng is looking to do the same  with bitcoin and booze to lure you in

on the fitness side grit cycles members through an instructorled circuit of boxing cardio and strength training  with a 1 million lighting and sound system creating an almost clublike ambiance grit is also cashing in on the bitcoin craze being the first gym to accept the currency on the employee side the company is offering its trainers up to 1000 per hour but one of the main selling points founder bill zanker is touting is the sense of community hes trying to build namely with a full liquor bar in the studio

soulcycle its kind of hard to meet someone on the bike because youre pedaling then even if youre in the mens room its kind of weird  you have a towel around you theres no real place after you had the joint experience to hang says zanker whos also the founder of adult education company the learning annex thats what we wanted to to do is build a community right after class you can hang out meet somebody talk to somebody have a drink with them and just hang

boutique studios are seeing a boom within the larger momentum of the fitness industry according to the international health racquet and sportsclub association the health club market is worth 872 billion globally and has grown every year since 2008 within the universe of bigbox gyms boutique studios account for 42 of the us club market and ihrsa data indicates that boutique memberships expanded 74 between 2012 and 2015 however 81 of studios close or fail in the first year so the road to fitness stardom is far from direct

grit is coming to the ring with headlinegrabbing sound bites but will it be enough to make any real noise

the idea for grit came about when zankers daughter ediva zanker was telling him how hard it was to meet people in the boxing studio she was attending zankers son dylan chimed in with the notion that the workouts had to be fun like a club including an adequate sound and light system as well as a bar and so in a rather unlikely trio zanker teamed up with motivational speaker tony robbins and rapper pitbull as investing and creative partners to launch grit in august with ediva and dylan serving as cofounders ; louisiana rapper boosie badazz recently sparked an intense debate online when he posted to instagram questioning dwyane wades parenting choices in the wake of wades public support for his daughter coming out as transgender in response boosie ranted that d wade had gone too fcking far and argued that at twelve years old zaya wouldnt have sht figured out yet he also demonstrated a woeful misunderstanding of what it means to be transgender

however it seems at 37 years old boosie hasnt quite figured out that words and actions have consequences but it looks like thats a lesson hes in the process of resisting learning today once again posting to instagram he claimed that the gay manager of a local planet fitness barred him from using the facilities over his comments about zaya wade saying manager who was gay refused to let me n planet fitness because of my past actions on social media about gender he also reeled off a list of complaints  which included roaches and a lack of hot water  about the facilities as well calling on his followers to boycott the gym

unfortunately he also doubled down on his earlier bigotry writing btch u want a gay child but dont nobody want to have a baby for yo sissy ass now u mad which is about as hateful as it is nonsensical meanwhile boosie is still being excoriated online outside of his own instagram comments with observers wondering why dwyane wade would take parenting advice from boosie in the first place considering some of the rappers own questionable parenting decisions ; rock island arsenal ill  medicine balls thud to the concrete floor while grunts of determination reverberate from the walls soldiers gathered in this unheated gym on a winter morning have no trouble keeping warm owing to their incessant activity

an army combat fitness test is underway in the trench first armys unofficial gym adjacent to its headquarters building the acft is slated to become the armys test of record this fall but success requires much more than undertaking a 90minute event the training for it has begun in earnest and soldiers of the first army united states army reserve support command are taking a diagnostic acft at each of their quarterly battle assemblies to get ready

the acft comprises six events completed in this order a threerepetition deadlift handrelease pushups standing power throw sprintdragcarry leg tuck and a twomile run the idea behind the new test is to simulate what would be required in combat the standards are the same for any age or gender with the only difference based on military occupational specialty besides 40pound kettlebells the test also requires a 90pound sled pullup bars hexagonal deadlift bar and free weights

coordinating the tests for the support command has been master sgt heidi lee a master fitness trainer while all the equipment necessary to conduct an acft has yet to arrive support command leaders are conducting the diagnostic tests with the best gear they can assemble

we were able to substitute lee said for instance we had 45pound kettlebells instead of 40pounds or we had all the gear for the sprintdragcarry but didnt have turf or grass so we did it on concrete

while the gear and conditions are a work in progress soldiers are still able to ready themselves for the test and get an idea of where they are proficient and where they need work

this month were hoping to see improvement from the soldiers who took it three months ago lee said and last time we did not test the graders so were testing them this time on another day so they can see where they are she added that the practice runs are also benefiting those in charge of the test as they seek to refine the process

compared to the army physical fitness test the acft doubles the number of events and permits less time between each one and with no consideration for age some longtime soldiers like 51yearold staff sgt jeffrey weber are learning to adapt

it was excruciating it was a lot different than the apft he said it definitely works you from head to toe im an older soldier and its the same standards that a 19yearold has to do

still he is not shrinking from the challenge im just trying to work toward it to train for it as much as i can weber said

weber and other reserve component soldiers are working out on their own time and between battle assemblies to be ready for the challenge

as soldiers prepare they become more familiar with the nuances of the test after many repetitions capt jeffrey frederick realized the standing power throw is about more than raw strength rather he said its about finding the best point to release the ball at and you have to practice on your own and figure out where that release is and how to move your body as youre throwing it

frederick added that his throwing technique is only one of many tasks he has to become familiar with

its different he said for so many years ive done the apft so its just a mind thing that i have to get past

his workouts have included some he coordinated with his active duty counterparts and trainers at augustana college in nearby rock island ill

im doing more core body workouts some calisthenic workouts and have worked some different muscles it was a good workout frederick said

while weber and the 50yearold frederick are learning to adjust 25yearold spc jacob beck is making a smooth transition i like the change he said i think the events better reflect the demands that come with being in the army

echoing those sentiments was capt erin demoss

its going to prepare soldiers better for reallife battlefield situations she said her personal experience with the new test has been positive

so far so good she said i work out six days a week i have specifically trained for the leg tuck because i know that will be difficult ive also worked on kettlebell swings and deadlifts to increase my score

likewise beck has plans to alter his gym routine

the workouts definitely have to change he said i dont deadlift much and thats going to be a big difference some of the events such as the leg tuck and handrelease pushup are mainly the same as the situp and pushup but its a little more demanding so you need to turn up the intensity of your workouts and with the sprintdragcarry youve really got work on your cardio because youve got to turn around and do a twomile run im going to keep working and see how much better i can do between the diagnostics and the first record test i think im in a good position but i always want to do better

lee said soldiers who embrace that attitude and work ethic will likely see the payoff when they take their first record acft this fall ; the circular smart ring is designed to look simple and appropriate for any occasion

over the past few years apps and smart devices have played a major role in helping people achieve both their fitness and overall wellbeing goals and while these devices can be helpful its not always clear how to fully utilize the given data to make changes in your daily habits but circular is looking to change that with a new smart ring that tracks your different biometrics such as sleep and activity patterns then tells you how to use that data to make improvements in your daily life

the company recently launched a kickstarter campaign for the circular smart ring which you can back starting at 197 with the pledge youll receive the circular ring two outer shells a charger a usb cable and more for 30 percent off the retail value

the ring uses an integrated intelligent companion called kira to analyze your activities and then makes specific suggestions on how to improve things like your sleep fitness and overall wellbeing you can access the data through its mobile app

according to the campaign circular worked with doctors phd students and other experts for more than a year to develop algorithms that effectively analyze your body signals this can be seen in the rings sleep tracker which not only lets you know how much rest youre getting throughout the night but how your sleep is affecting your performance throughout the day and how your daily activities are impacting your sleep

the ring also functions as an alarm in two ways one option is to set a specific time yourself and the ring will silently vibrate to wake you up in the second option the ring analyzes your sleep patterns senses when you are in your lightest sleep phase and vibrates to wake you up

the rings activity tracking allows you to look at your physical activity through different measurements like heart rate steps taken and more with that you can look in the app and see visuals depicting your fitness progress from there youll get suggestions on how to improve aspects of your wellness such as your energy levels

like many other smart devices the ring alerts you when youve received a text message or phone call however unlike other devices you can also silence your ringing phone or skip a song youre listening to simply by tapping the ring

the device can last for up to two days on a single charge is scratchproof and waterresistant and comes with different color options for the outer shell such as gray or rose gold so you can dress it up a bit currently the sizes range from a us size six to a us size 12

with 181204 raised the company already surpassed the original 21962 goal but you can still help bring this project to life until march 4 by heading here ; improvements for a play area at a park in sherwood have been revealed following feedback from local residents

the playground at woodthorpe park in sherwood is set to be enlarged and have some new equipment added aimed at children under10

there are also plans to improve the surface under the new and existing equipment to enhance safety and the appearance of the area

following consultation nottingham city council said there was a desire for outdoor fitness equipment to be added also which is due to be carried out near the play area

the council said to address the popularity of the play area and café it was in the process of installing a hard free draining surface to better cater for visitors all year round

work has been significantly delayed due to the ongoing weather conditions however works are continuing as and when the weather allows

the total cost of the scheme is 120000  64000 has been awarded by fcc communities foundation and 10000 from the ministry of housing communities and local government

the remainder has come from section 106  money from local area planning agreements  and internal budgets

as the money was only confirmed in january there is no official completion dates but from manufacturing timescales the council estimates it to be finished after easter

residents in the area had a mixed response to the plans with one man feeling the money could be better spent elsewhere

occupational therapist hayley pedley 42 from mapperley said of the plan i think it all looks really nice and i think its a really good area for kids to play with lots of different things to explore

rebekah daley 42 of mapperley works as a school finance administrator

she said itll be great because the park itself has probably been there since i was little but there hasnt been much changed since i was little

not much has been changed since so itll be nice for it to be a bit fresh with new exciting things for the kids to play on

it needs a revamp its probably been at least a good 15 years since theyve done anything so itll be a very welcome change especially with growing families

councillor dave trimble portfolio holder for leisure and culture said we are is delighted that the project is now starting to take shape

according to our news partners at the pittsburgh postgazette real estate sources say millcraft investments and la fitness have reached a deal to lease the space

the building has been vacant after the ymca of greater pittsburgh filed for bankruptcy in 2018

the new la fitness is expected to open sometime this year the postgazette reports millcraft officials declined to comment to the postgazette and la fitness representatives couldnt be reached

while there are no la fitness locations downtown there are several in the pittsburgh area with the closest one in larimer and south side ; so she ran and ran even though she really really hated being on the treadmill but she never did meet that goal

the girl was me whos now spent years studying exercise physiology and understands that 30 minutes a day on the treadmill  or doing any form of steadystate cardio  isnt necessarily going to help me reach my longterm fitness goals

fastforward six years i now follow a workout routine that includes just one steadystate cardio workout per week unless im training for a race more on that later the rest is all highintensity interval training weightlifting and crossfit and much to the surprise of circa2014 me ive met my body composition goals among many others

if you too have been slogging away on the treadmill stairmaster or elliptical and youre looking for a way out this is it

what most people commonly know as steadystate cardio and intervals are scientifically aerobic exercise and anaerobic exercise respectively aerobic means with oxygen while anaerobic means without oxygen

your body uses different energy pathways to support different types of exercise when you exercise aerobically your body utilizes oxygen to support sustained exercise this kind of movement is what most people think of when they think of cardio walking jogging biking hiking stairstepping swimming

when you do anaerobic exercise your body produces energy in the absence of oxygen this happens when your cardiovascular system heart lungs and blood vessels cant distribute enough oxygen to support the demands of the exercise youre doing  which is why anaerobic exercise is only performed in short bursts or intervals

examples of anaerobic exercise include sprinting the 100meter dash long jumps high jumps and burpees basically any movement that requires a high level of exertion for a short period of time constitutes anaerobic exercise even heavy weightlifting lifting a lot of weight for just one to five reps uses the anaerobic pathway but for the purposes of this guide well stick to cardio exercises

the fun thing about anaerobic exercise is that you can turn any traditionally aerobic exercise into an anaerobic workout take cycling as an example cycling for 20 minutes at a steady pace is aerobic but cycling very fast for 30 seconds resting for 30 seconds and repeating for a total of 10 minutes is anaerobic

your body often switches between aerobic and anaerobic exercise during workouts that require varying levels of effort in the cycling example above if you keep moving during your 30 seconds of rest but at a slower pace your body uses oxygen to support that 30 seconds of easy movement

steadystate cardio and intervals both offer their own set of benefits  but they are only beneficial to you if youre doing the correct type of cardio to meet your goals

aerobic exercise primarily improves endurance and stamina or your ability to exercise for long periods of time it increases the capacity of your cardiovascular system to supply your working muscles with the oxygen and nutrients they need to keep moving

aerobic exercise has also been linked to improved immunity decreased risk of many chronic diseases improved heart health boosted mood and stronger bones  several benefits that make aerobic exercise worth more than just the fitness outcomes

when it comes to components of fitness anaerobic exercise mainly improves speed and power it can help you run fast jump higher and hike steeper inclines anaerobic exercise is also known to increase your vo2 max promote faster and more significant weight loss as well as contribute to improved body composition  this is why hiit earned its place as a top training option for people focused on losing fat

anaerobic exercise has health benefits too like aerobic exercise interval training can reduce your risk of chronic diseases improve heart health and strengthen your bones especially if you incorporate resistance training into your intervals anaerobic exercise can also speed up your metabolism especially during the hours following your workout

to determine which type of cardio you need to do you must first look at the longterm outcome you desire its helpful to play the if then game with this for example

if you want to get a personal record on your 5k then you need to do both

the reason you need to incorporate both forms of cardio in the last example is because achieving a personal record for a 5k requires speed and endurance you wont beat your best time if you keep running 31 miles at the same pace  adding one or two speedbased interval workouts each week will improve your anaerobic capacity and allow you to run faster for longer

read more the 7 most important workout moves you should be doing

as evidenced by the above examples there is no best form of cardio  it all depends on your goals in fitness theres a saying train for what you do this typically applies to people who compete in various fitness disciplines but you neednt compete in anything for the concept to apply to you

think of it this way

seems pretty obvious right it all circles back to the if then game  work out according to your goals

dont feel like youre stuck to one kind of cardio because of your current goal however all movement is good movement even if it doesnt directly correlate to the outcome you want right now in fact you can benefit from changing up your routine to avoid exercise boredom and burnout as well as reduce your risk of repetitive stress injuries

when im training for a longdistance race i might swap a long run for an intervalstyle workout for no reason other than that i feel like it ill probably make up the long run at some point but even if i dont that one swap wont hurt me in the long run as long as the majority of your workouts match your goal youre golden

it has come to our attention that a bogus notice has been circulating through various messaging apps claiming that fitness first singapore clubs are closed until further notice it said in a statement posted on facebook

we wish to clarify that this is not true and that all our clubs are operating normally

we will be filing a police report and will work closely with the authorities to investigate the matter it added

the fake notice looked similar to one fitness first singapore posted on its official facebook page on wednesday saying with the increasing number of reported cases of novel coronavirus pneumonia extended precautionary measures will be implemented to ensure your wellbeing and safety in the clubs

two images were uploaded with the post bearing measures such as increased cleaning and sanitisation provision of additional hand sanitisers as well as the health and travel declarations the company also reminded members and guests to practice good personal hygiene

ighalo joined united from shanghai shenhua on a transfer deadline day in a surprise loan deal and the former watford forward could make his debut for his new club in next mondays premier league clash at chelsea

while his new teammates are away at uniteds winter break training camp in malaga the 30yearold has stayed behind in manchester to undergo oneonone sessions with specialist coaches who are tasked to getting him ready for ole gunnar solskjaers side

he was doing his preseason he had just started that out in china performance coach wayne richardson told the manchester evening news

so it is a case of a lot of not wanting to load him up with too much too soon you have got to remember he is on the back of a whirlwind with man united he has come in and it has all been about mobility flexibility and trying really basic things in his first week

now were looking to load him up and look at his intensity as well so he was in pretty decent shape when he came across he was doing stuff anyway before he came over

richardson  who has worked with former manchester city and liverpool forwrd mario balotelli in the past  went further into ighalos regime

there will be a lot of strength work legs lowers hamstrings flexibility and mobility before we start going into a strength based session and then in between that we have to be mindful that he is doing football with a onetoone coach as well he said

so just getting back into it with his crossing shooting different things where the football coach is considered

peloton doesnt spend money on influencer marketing  technically

to build socialmedia hype the athome fitness startup turns to its legion of fitnessfamous instructors to promote the brand on instagram and facebook

each day many of the companys 21 cycling pros interact with peloton users and promote the brand to their more than 23 million followers across instagram twitter and facebook their reach trumps pelotons own social accounts which is about half the size on the three platforms the company has an additional 11 instructors who teach treadmill and yoga classes

its a very important way to connect with our members in real time said alex toussaint a senior peloton cycling instructor with 105000 instagram followers for certain rides where you have thousands of members its hard to give shoutouts to everyone social media is another way you can connect with those members

while other companies have had to address bad publicity from employees posting on social media  for instance a viral tiktok showing how paneras mac and cheese was made created headaches for the company last year  peloton has leaned into allowing its instructors to build online followings

peloton instructors actively encourage users to reach out to them on social media

write me ill write you back trainer jess king told viewers at the end of a 30minute cycling class in november my name is jess jesskingnyc on instagram she said at the close of another session

right after class i go right to my phone and interact on social media toussaint said whether its facebook twitter or instagram it provides members with another way of gaining information and connecting with instructors

toussaint and his colleagues regularly reshare peloton members stories on instagram respond to questions on twitter and send updates to followers reminding them of when theyre teaching classes

not everybody knows your schedule down to the t so i think its important to put your classes out there he said

instructors also promote peloton apparel on their social accounts both by wearing the brand on clothes in their profile photos and directly linking to pelotons ecommerce pages

peloton doesnt require brand exclusivity when it comes to the socialmedia accounts of its team of instructors toussaint also promotes lebron james supplement company ladder on his instagram profile fellow peloton instructor ally love who has 240000 instagram followers is a brand ambassador for adidas

peloton has obviously helped all of us grow our following he said at the end of the day this is your brand youre not forced to do anything he noted that peloton doesnt contractually require its instructors to post online

efforts to integrate social media into the peloton experience make sense given that one of the companys main selling points is its ability to give users a sense of community virtually without having to be present in a physical studio

the company has its own social engagement tools built into its fitness app users can see whos taking a class by viewing a leaderboard and here now feature they can follow friends to see when theyre working out and view their fitness performance down to the number of calories they burned in an individual session the app offers a ride with friends notification that lets you know if someone you follow is biking concurrently and you can offer a supportive high five to a user during a class the company even has a video chat feature where you can bike facetoface with other users during a ride

continuing to interact with users off the bike is an extension of the virtual community peloton is trying to build with members who can afford its 2245 stationery bike 4295 treadmill or 39 monthly app membership 1299 for users who dont use a peloton bike or treadmill

peloton did not make an executive available for an interview but a spokesperson said in a statement social media allows instructors to share aspects of their stories that they cant always explore fully while teaching this helps them deepen their connection with our members by demonstrating how they apply the concepts and ideas they talk about in class to their own lives

the company acknowledged the importance of its instructors as brand promoters in the risk factors section of its ipo filing last year

also imperative to our success are our fitness instructors who we rely on to bring new exciting and innovative fitness and wellness content to our platform and who act as brand ambassadors the company wrote our instructors are not only authorities in their respective areas of fitness but also relatable magnetic personalities who inspire passionate followings

on average pelotons cycling instructors fall into the microinfluencer category on instagram which includes creators with between 10000 and 100000 followers as defined by the influencer marketing firm viral nation six of its trainers are midtier instagram influencers meaning they have between 100000 and 500000 followers and collectively the group has the audience reach of a macro influencer

while instagram remains the top app for peloton instructors the company chose to link to the facebook pages of its trainers on the instructors page of its website none of pelotons trainers have significant followings on youtube or tiktok but the hashtags peloton and pelotonchallenge have 37 million and 14 million video views on tiktok

having a team of influencers to promote its brand could pay off for peloton as investors continue to scrutinize other aspects of its advertising spend after backtoback quarterly losses

the company faced pushback over its 9figure annual marketing budget when it went public and marketing and sales accounted for 62 of operating expenses in the companys most recent quarterly report peloton also saw market backlash for a holiday ad it aired last quarter that sparked criticism and parodies on social media

the company does pay for traditional banner and native advertising on socialmedia platforms like facebook and instagram but its influencer strategy is centered around its existing employees

competitors like equinox and soul cycle who also benefit from having instagramfamous trainers on their staff have leaned into influencer marketing more broadly equinox which owns soul cycle launched a talent agency for fitness influencers in 2018 to accelerate digital exposure and secure meaningful partnership and sponsorship opportunities for fitness influencers regardless of whether they worked for the company

while toussaint promotes other brands online as a wellknown fitness influencer he said peloton remains his focus

at the end of the day peloton is always the priority no matter what he said ; it had not occurred to chicagoan delores tomorrow to audition for a reality television show  until one of tomorrows clients who was hoping to be chosen as one of the trainers on the biggest loser suggested she apply

tomorrow a 34yearold event planner who runs the nonprofit iglow mentoring told her client she wasnt big enough to be on the show her client responded that tomorrow  who weighed 280 pounds the heaviest in her life  certainly was

the next day tomorrow talked with representatives from the show and a month later she was in new mexico along with 11 other competitors to see who could lose the most weight and be crowned the biggest loser divided into two groups the 12 worked out and competed in team challenges then participated in a weighin that eliminated someone each week until just one winner remained

tomorrow made it to the fourth week before being sent home at that point she had lost a total of 23 pounds and learned some things about herself

one of the hardest pieces for me was the emotional piece tomorrow said this past week a day before the episode in which shes sent home aired feb 18 on usa network i never realized how much emotions impacted this i never really knew how stress would stop me from losing weight even if i was doing the right things

being a part of the show was hard tomorrow said starting with the first team challenge running one mile i dont run she said during the first episode in fact she had never run even one block before that day she was the last person to cross the finish line for her team however i did it that felt great

what didnt feel great was having no contact with friends family and coworkers youre literally in a bubble not able to talk to anyone besides the people youre living with phones and computers are confiscated and none of the competitors can leave the site the focus is on working out eating healthy and losing weight

when youre pushed in that bubble and you remove the things you have been coping with  like food  it forces you to just deal with you it forces you to deal with things that youve been blinded to she said

everything tomorrow did during the month she was on the show was hard but the real work started the day i left the campus  i was not in a controlled environment

it was challenging to integrate what she had learned into her everyday life running a nonprofit which prepares young women of color for college and beyond shes on the road a lot staying in hotels and not getting enough sleep what we did on the show is not realistic for everyday life  the idea of me working out five to seven hours a day is just not feasible one day the competitors worked out nine hours though not all at once

tomorrow is proud shes not gained any weight since returning home last fall she cant say more because shes not allowed to disclose her weight until the show finishes airing later this spring shes especially pleased about maintaining her weight despite taking 21 girls from her nonprofit on a trip to london and paris earlier this year

some of the changes shes made include regularly ordering from the childrens menu and at the airport instead of working on her laptop she walks the terminal sometimes up to 90 minutes to get in those steps

she looks for practical things that can be adopted for a lifetime like finding those opportunities to move and replacing the juice and soda she used to drink with water

i never want to go back and to not go back i have to adopt things that are going to work for me

she also wants to help others especially the 3000 girls who participate in iglow mentoring to make changes tomorrow called two of the nonprofits participants when she and the rest of the competitors were allowed to make their first call home

during that video chat she tearfully tells the girls i felt like i was not a great example to you all  i have just neglected myself and my health for so long so this was pretty drastic for me to do i felt like i had to do it to because i needed to be an example not just to you all but to all the girls

since returning home shes made changes at home and work before competing on the biggest loser it had not occurred to tomorrow to incorporate health and wellness into her nonprofits curriculum thats being added and theyre also more mindful of food thats served at events

being sent home after week 4 was a surprise because that was the week i just knew i just killed it said tomorrow who also worked on the advance team for former first lady michelle obama from 2009 to 2016

her friend and former colleague matti mceachen 25 was killed by falling masonry outside his workplace southern ink tattoo parlour on colombo st alongside customer rachel conley 27

matti was a special guy and ill be reflecting on times we spent together many years ago gunn said ; jurgen klopps side went down 10 to atletico madrid in the champions league

liverpool face an anxious wait to discover if captain jordan henderson will miss a key period of their season after he suffered a hamstring injury

the 29yearold was substituted during tuesdays 10 defeat by atletico madrid and was limping when he left the stadium liverpool stayed overnight in spain but henderson felt sore before the flight home

how long henderson is out will become clear after a scan on thursday but liverpool are already resigned to him missing monday nights clash with west ham

liverpool are anxious over jordan hendersons fitness after he picked up a hamstring injury

the liverpool captain was forced off on tuesday and will undergo a scan this week

they face a busy spell in the coming weeks with premier league fixtures against watford and bournemouth sandwiching the fa cup fifthround match at chelsea as well as the home leg of their last16 champions league tie against atletico on march 11

whether henderson is absent for one game or more it will be a major blow for jurgen klopp because his skipper has been in outstanding form over the past four months and is favourite to be named pfa player of the year

liverpool for once failed to come up with answers to the test atletico set them on tuesday and losing a big game is not a feeling the squad have been familiar with over the past 12 months

the onegoal deficit however is hardly beyond retrieval

club staff are concerned the 29yearold may miss a key period of the season with the problem

its going to be a difficult game said defender virgil van dijk when asked to assess liverpools prospects of turning things around in the second leg

but we should be confident we cant let this defeat bring us down in any way at all were never happy with losing

its been a while as well but we have to believe in ourselves like we always do were frustrated we lost but still have another 90 minutes

we have to be patient but atletico have shown over the last couple of years that its very difficult to score goals and break them down

they got help from the fans their manager was fired up with them we expected it but it started with the goal we conceded we gave them something to hold on to ; coe also emphasises this point its a myth that eating lots of extra protein equals bigger muscles while protein supplements are popular among some gymgoers for muscle building they are generally unnecessary as most active people can easily get enough protein from a healthy varied diet including highquality lean protein foods

anyone who watched the documentary the game changers will have seen vegan athletes and experts talking about how following a vegan diet and performing to a high standard go hand in hand they advocate taking on both plantbased carbs and protein

while the documentary has faced criticism it does highlight that theres a seemingly growing community of professional vegan athletes how does this work in practice

tom huelin is the fitness coach for league twos forest green rovers  the worlds first 100 percent vegan football club as part of his responsibilities he gives nutrition advice to the team

while the players are in control of their own meals at home at work they follow a vegan diet and there are a lot of vegetarians and a couple of vegans in the squad

however being a vegan club doesnt make the nutritional requirements different from those of any other team tom explains that both protein and carbs in particular are a big focus for the footballers requirements and the amounts prescribed depend on the football schedule

footballs a results business and the most important time to be nutritionally prepared is on match day so you just start with that and work backwards into the training days to make sure youre at your optimum on match day huelin says before explaining what each day needs to include

the basics are on the days theyre going to be working harder they consume more carbs and they make sure after intensive sessions they receive a topup of protein to help with muscular fatigue to help encourage the team to receive the correct nutrition when theyre off the clock they have access to an online resource which includes recipes for vegan meals

the vegan element of it is key we can attribute lots of positive things to it  physically and in terms of the levels of recovery players are feeling less fatigued these are anecdotal of course so while it might be they get these effects from following at least a semiplanbased diet we dont know for sure the fitness coach says

is it a challenge to get all the right nutrients into the players on a vegan diet no and thats because there are now good vegan plant protein supplements it wasnt always the case when i first joined the club i found it really tricky to get something that had a sufficient amount  and the right type  of protein in the last four years though as veganism has become fashionable more and more sports nutrition brands are developing vegan protein products and we use things like soy milk which is really high in protein ; key point soldiers need to have a high degree of physical fitness however not all soldiers perform the same tasks

when gen dwight d eisenhower issued a letter to his troops just before the dday landings in normandy in 1944 he told them i have full confidence in your courage devotion to duty and skill in battle he was writing to american troops who had to meet these minimum physical requirements seven pullups 31 jump squats 27 pushups 52 situps and a 300yard sprint in 525 seconds soldiers  all of them  had to be fit in 1944

compare those to contemporary requirements in the us army where young male recruits now face a test requiring a minimum of 35 pushups 47 situps and a twomile run time of 1636

in some ways a shift has already begun and there has been a reduction in overall fitness requirements the us military has modernized and transitioned to more mechanization and automation while the wars in iraq and afghanistan have exhibited a continued need for intensive counterinsurgent ground combat only about 20 of american military personnel have jobs that require a combat role  and thus combat fitness such battlefields require less sweat more sit

senior leadership is beginning to recognize this

years back secretary of defense ash carter led the charge to adapt the us military to this new less industrial warfare in a 2015 speech he addressed the heart of the problem fewer young americans are capable of serving in the military of the 21 million americans aged 1721 we estimate that only about half are able to meet our highquality standards on our entry exam

factor in physical fitness and character standards carter continued and only about a third are actually eligible to join the military it is promising that carter is considering the easing of standards including fitness for certain hightech military positions to contend with newly evolving forms of warfare

this is hardly just an american problem the israeli military has begun adapting its force structure to accommodate and integrate some of its citizens with mental and physical disabilities into specialized military jobs if israel a country on permanent alert has made these changes they are worth seriously considering here

still many argue that standardized military physical fitness requirements in each service are a prerequisite tradition and that all should be fit enough for ground combat some even contend that physical fitness standards are necessary to control ballooning healthcare costs over the long term to which a recent report says 50 billion of the annual dod budget goes

the problem with such arguments is that they ignore the transition away from industrialage forms of warfare today most enemies avoid direct combat and are not intimidated by how professional a soldier looks in uniform

similarly an emphasis on standardized military fitness standards to save on healthcare costs undermines longterm national security by limiting the talent pool of military personnel recruited and retained  a pool that usually excels in highly technical jobs that merely require the physical capability of sitting in an office chair for extended periods indeed there is something perversely wrong with the fitness regimen when an air force colonel and kc135 pilot is relieved of his wing commander job just because his waist is greater than 39 inches

american adversaries are increasingly engaging in hybrid forms of warfare that blend unconventional irregular and informationcyber warfare provocative military operations by the chinese in the south china sea and russia in ukraine illuminate this new era of perplexing lowintensity conflict this shift means the us military needs the right mix of brawn and brains while also highlighting that raw military power no longer wins or deters by itself in the 21st century

a troubling 2016 report from the government accountability office identified the serious threat cyberattacks posed to the us government including the dod the gao report noted that in 2006 there were 5503 attacks but by 2015 there had been 77183 attacks this is nearly a 1300 increase in just a decade continued adherence to present fitness standards in all military branches is not going to prevent future attacks

a burly marine may repel the taliban in afghanistan or an elite special forces unit may engage islamic state fighters in urban warfare but these are just peripheral threats the real existential threat to the united states comes not from terrorists but instead from an army of cyber proxies that steal trade secrets and classified documents and can cause severe infrastructural industrial and economic damage the office of personnel management breach of over 20 million government personnel records by suspected chinese hackers illustrates the true danger and consequences of not recruiting and developing the right cadre of mentally rather than physically fit cyber warriors to maintain american dominance even recent russian meddling in the american election process underscores the danger of this subversive warfare to democratic political institutions

it may sound sacrilegious to suggest that the military should drop another tradition and lower fitness standards but not doing so puts the united states at greater risk fitness standards for ground combat intensive jobs should remain high but throughout the services physical standards should be revised to match the fitness requirements of each job specialty if even israel can ignore fitness requirements in lieu of finding the right people to fill noncombat jobs then the us military can easily do the same the military should adopt appropriate weight and fitness standards for citizens that want to serve in positions that enable american superiority in air sea space and cyber domains as well as on the ground

armando nava jr aka navathebeast served in the us marines for four years before taking to youtube to vlog about life after the military while hes not training with swat teams and teaching powerlifters how to crush the brutal marine corps physical fitness test nava can be found demonstrating the extensive lessons he learned from the marines while putting his body through hell in a recent video nava brought his friend and fellow veteran marcus perez in front of the camera to see if they could both take on the famously grueling us navy seals physical fitness test pft

navas version of the test wasnt exactly what youd have to take on if you were trying to be a seal yourself  the standard test calls for a 500 yard swim in 12 minutes 30 seconds 50 pushups in 2 minutes at least 50 curlups situps in 2 minutes at least 10 pullups in 2 minutes and a 15 mile run in at least 10 minutes and 30 seconds nava and perez flip the order and do the run first then skip the curlups entirely since theyre not planning to enlist well cut them some slack

the first portion of the test is a 15 mile run which nava knocks out in 10 minutes and eight seconds  about 639 per mile perez time is considerably slower but finishes in just under 17 minutes

i havent run in a minute says an out of breath nava but this is a good start with marcus running in the background nava reminds his audience to use his video for inspiration as what hes doing is easy to watch but hard to do

next up pushups navy seals need to do at least 98 reps to qualify for the optimum distinction nava and perez are aiming for 100 the guys hammer away at the 100pushup goal sweating through the pain as nava narrates

the only way youre gonna get better is by putting yourself through that pain and that suffering because thats whats going to mold you and thats whats going to make you a stronger individual

seventy pushups in nava is unable to continue and taps out of the challenge while marcus just makes it to 100 as the guys rise from the floor physically shaking they head inside to handle the next portion of the fitness test pullups

nava and marcus only have to make it to 15 to meet the optimum requirement but they aim for 20 after each hitting the target reps marcus and nava head out to conquer the very last challenge a 500meter swim

we pushing through this pain says nava as he prepares to swim 10 laps and so should you lets go finish this test

the guys absolutely go beastmode during the final swim clocking in at eight minutes and five seconds

im sore and hungry says marcus im just glad i attempted it

as the video wraps nava once again tells viewers to not only watch his videos but go out and actually do what hes doing yourself after a 15 mile run pushups pullups and a swim nava showcases the physical toll the body goes through to make the cut for the elite branches of the military ; the charlotte coworking brand hygge is expanding into the fitness industry

over 300 soldiers were found to have enlisted after either failing a required fitness test or never taking it at all according to documents obtained by army times

in 2017 the army was straining to meet its goal of 476000 activeduty soldiers meaning the service had to bring in 68000 recruits the occupational physical assessment test was new and army times reports that recruiters implicated in the investigation  297 of them  figured the recruits would sort out their fitness levels at basic

according to the report obtained by army times recruiters perceived that they were under pressure by the mission increase and the requirement to fill training seats during a historically low period of accessions into the army to ship recruits as quickly as possible

the investigators who looked into the issue also wrote in their report that many of the recruiters did not fully grasp how to administer the opat or the significance of the testing requirements

the investigation involved 38 of the armys recruiting battalions excluding only new york city and richmond virginia per army times the worst offender was dallas texas passing through 38 untested recruits who never took the fitness test

overall there were 318 soldiers who said they either never took the test or that they failed it 228 allegations were substantiated and us army recruiting command spokeswoman lisa ferguson told army times that appropriate action was taken in each case

in response to the investigation in 2017 usarec put new requirements in place army recruits must sign their opat score cards those score cards must be reviewed by someone designated by the recruiting center and both the recruits and recruiters signatures have to be validated by a guidance counselor per army times

the recruits at the center of the investigation were ultimately allowed to stay and continue training

we met up with these three young brothers who have been into fitness their whole lives and now at age 23 are literally making it their business

triyo fitness  instagram ; dundalk fc head coach vinny perth expressed his shock at the the leesiders 60 hammering at the hands of shamrock rovers pic sportsfile

ahead of the visit of cork city on monday night dundalk fc head coach vinny perth expressed his shock at the the leesiders 60 hammering at the hands of shamrock rovers

dundalk who have beaten cork in all of their last seven meetings will be hoping to make it three wins from three in this seasons sse airtricity league when they welcome neale fenns team to oriel park

fenns young side are up against it having lost both of their opening two matches shipping seven goals in the process without scoring one themselves but perth is nonetheless expecting a tough contest

we have to be ready for monday theyll come up here with a game plan said perth on friday night

im shocked by that corks loss because i saw them against shels last week and thought they were very good neale has done a good job up until obviously tonight so hell be disappointed with that

perth was pleased with his own sides performance on week two which saw them secure a very hardfought 21 win over a newlypromoted shelbourne side in difficult conditions at tolka park

i thought we showed a real determination particularly in the last halfanhour i hope it was also exciting as well because i think the league needs games like that where theres something on the line as much as it wasnt a pure football game i hope there was a bit of excitement to it

you must give shels credit they pushed us and played a certain way they were brave they played 442 and got the ball forward i thought defensively seán hoare and andy boyle were really good because ciarán kilduffs a handful

we generally start slow i was a bit worried missing five attackers but they were two difficult games that was a really difficult game there considering the conditions tonight so im very happy

after a stellar debut against derry city on openingnight greg sloggett playing in a more advanced role put in another outstanding performance against shels much to the delight of perth who outlined the overall importance of the new signings that have been brought into the club this year

greg sloggett showed why we hold him in the highest regard i thought his performance in particular was very good the midfield had to stand up and be men and i think they did tonight

weve got a huge influence of young players coming through the squad is evolving weve been criticised as a club criticised as a team a lot of late its ironic that were called a very old team

the youth thats come into the squad the last four or five years is massive and in particular the last four or five weeks so were in a good place to drive on

for the cork game dundalk will again be without the injured duo of john mountney and seán murray while patrick mceleney and georgie kelly are touchandgo in terms of their fitness

perth is also hopeful that stefan colovic will link up with the squad at some stage this week ; if youre thinking about joining one heres what you need to know to make it through to the end

if youve hit a plateau are seeking some fitness motivation or simply looking to take your workouts up a notch fitness challenges are a great way to give yourself the energy boost you need ranging anywhere from 3 weeks to 3 months many gyms and fitness studios have begun to pop up on social media offering all sorts of shortterm programs geared toward maximizing results and allowing you to build a tribe while doing so

because recommitting myself to my health and fitness was a top new years resolution of mine i decided to give it a go and join in on a challenge myself i signed up for sweat dcs byob be your own body goals challenge which is a sixweek twice a week in the evenings program that includes a fitness assessment and reassessment meal plans photos goals consultation nutrition guide and of course weekly classes

so if youve been thinking about joining a challenge  and you totally should  here are a few things i learned that will ensure your own success

having a community makes a difference

the reason i chose sweat dc specifically was because the entire theme of the gym is to inspire guests to be more confident in their own skin the coaches are friendly and the environment is race gender and size inclusive which is very rare in the wellness space what made sweat dcs challenge much more beneficial was having a tribe of women that i got to see every week they had similar goals were friendly and at the very least familiar faces while we endured our weekly torture er classes not only is this necessary for extra motivation and ensuring that you all have like minded music tastes for your group workouts but also it ensures accountability you might make some friends in the process and at the very least youll feel encouraged to keep working at it when you can scroll through the photos of other women out there with you

if youre not going to commit 110 then dont waste your time

not only do these challenges require you to show up daily or multiple times per week they also require a financial commitment so its best to be honest with yourself and your pockets if its something you truly want to do and the first step in that is preparing yourself mentally for whats in store in my experience the best way to prepare for a fitness challenge is to set ourselves up for success says nazinga thomas lead coach and former track athlete who leads the byob program having a moment with yourself about how committed you are having the self integrity to hold ourselves accountable during the highs and the lows and having compassion and patience with ourselves because we are human and wont meet our highest expectation 100 and its all good

and while a fitness challenge may be a commitment or even a bit little extreme to some who arent used to consistently working out this is a shortterm endeavor and youll have to make it a priority if you want to stick to it and see results

plan all of your workouts in advance

the second most important thing is to go ahead and schedule those workouts  all of them  right after you sign up signing up for your classes in advance and paying for them means you will not want to waste the money so you will be much more likely to stick to your good intentions and show up not to mention it keeps you on a routine for the duration of the program if its on the calendar you likely wont cancel for me it doesnt exist if its not on my calendar its also helpful because youll be able to plan your social life around it the same way you would schedule anything else

trust the process

rome wasnt built in a day and neither will your summer body make a habit of trusting yourself and continue working hard no matter the numbers that you see on the scale each day or week though most trainers recommend you shouldnt be weighing yourself everyday anyway dont worry about the outcome and only focus on what you do because some of the most beneficial gains that youll see wont even be on the scale

many people join fitness challenges with the expectation of losing weight but i always like to encourage people to look at their other victories says thomas working outeating healthy consistently is a victory having more energy and motivation is a victory having a better self image is a victory there are so many other positives that can occur give yourself the credit you deserve

the end result of me trusting the process yes a few pounds of course but also increased stamina endurance and the ability to complete the same set of workouts in a shorter period of time then when i first started ; madonna has cancelled two more shows in london but said she was defying the orders of doctors who have told her she should be playing even fewer nights

the star 61 said she has multiple injuries meaning she has to do six hours of rehab every day she performs

she is currently doing a residency at the london palladium but has called off the shows on 4 and 11 february

that means she will not have three gigs in a row  but doctors told her two consecutive nights were still too much

she had previously cancelled her first london show on monday after also calling off performances in portugal

in a statement on instagram on friday she wrote as you all know i have multiple injuries and have had to cancel shows to give me time to recover

so as not to surprise you i want to let you know ahead of time that i will be cancelling 2 shows  on feb 4 and feb 11th at the palladium in london because doing 3 shows in a row is too much on my body and in fact my doctors insist i take a day off after every show but i believe can manage if i do 2 shows then i rest

its a miracle i have gotten this far but a lot has to do with the fact that i do 6 hours of rehab every day 3 hours before show and 3 after with multiple therapies

i have also switched to flat shoes and modified difficult parts of the show this has helped enormously but i still need to be careful and of course rest is the best medicine

of course i never want to cancel any show and im determined that i will make it to the end if i pace myself god willing

she added that she appreciates the fans understanding and apologised for any inconvenience

on tuesday she took to the palladium stage wearing knee supports but still performed high kicks yoga poses and even the splits during a twoandahalfhour show ; medicine hat ab  a new program at the strathcona centre aims to encourage seniors in medicine hat to stay active as they get older

the participants are all new moms some for the first time others arent new to motherhood just the class

wannenburg founded 4th trimester fitness method after a career as a nursemidwife personal trainer and mom to help other women lead healthy physical and emotional lives during pregnancy and after giving birth

theres a lot of change that has to occur in those first six weeks after birth so what were focusing on are movement patterns your breathing how your core and pelvic floor are relatedas youre lifting those babies in car seats theres not a lot of education out there so its really important for these moms to understand how to move in their new bodies wannenburg said

on this particular chilly tuesday in february wannenburg places yoga mats resistance bands and balls around the room for week three of the sixweek postpartum recovery series

today they begin squatting wannenburg said theyre learning the ability to go from sit to stand without feeling like everythings falling out especially when youre carrying the baby or the car seat and the baby bag and your groceries or maybe youve got the toddler pulling on your leg too

the women file into class with babies in tow and plenty to catch up on since the last time they saw each other

its such an important time for the transition of a mother they can feel so left behind we really place a huge emphasis on community in these groups of mothers thats a lot of what we do in class

wannenburg said sometimes moms can start the program as early as 10 days after birth and some care providers who are familiar with 4th trimester fitness method have been known to recommend their cesarean section patients as early as three to four weeks

wannenburg moved to knoxville from florida where most of her classes are conducted

its cool because a lot of times friendships are built and they go through several babies together and come back to classes together thats been really fun to watch wannenburg said

shes hoping to grow the east tennessee program but is in need of certified instructors since she still spends most of her time in florida ; kuala lumpur the late actor ashraf sinclair may have been involved in highintensity interval training hitt but he never overexerted himself

ashrafs fitness trainer oka tripambudi said that the 40yearolds death last tuesday came as a shock to him

in a news report yesterday oka said that ashraf underwent hitt at his gymnasium at 730pm last monday and looked normal

he always did hitt at his own pace and spent an hour and a half at the gym he was in good spirits as usual it was always a pleasure to train him he was very cooperative said oka

oka added that ashraf did not have a fixed exercise routine and only visited the gym when he was free

weve been doing hitt since 2012 and have been great friends since then losing him so suddenly has shocked and saddened me said oka

ashraf who was married to top indonesian singer and actress bunga citra lestari since 2008 died in his sleep at 451am

the gol  gincu proksi and j2 j resolusi star was buried at the san diego hills memorial park cemetery in karawang near jakarta indonesia after asar prayers on tuesday ; if youre big into your health and fitness or have been trying to lose weight at any point over the last few years then youll have heard about the keto diet

the popular diet involves eating foods which will put your body into a state known as ketosis

ketosis is a metabolic state characterised by a raised levels of ketone bodies in the body tissues

this body state is often entered into by people who have diabetes because a lack of insulin in the body causes it to break down fat for energy

and this is exactly what the keto diet tries to do  it limits your intake of carbohydrates and replaces them with fat in order to push your body into rapidly burning fat for energy

not only does this include the high level of fats youre ingesting but also supposedly the fat on your body too

there are four main variations on the keto diet these include

standard ketogenic diet skd this version typically means that youll eat 75 fat 20 protein and 5 carbs cyclical ketogenic diet ckd this involves periods of highcarb refeeds like eating five days keto and two days highcarb targeted ketogenic diet tkd on this version you can up your carbs around exercise highprotein ketogenic diet the ratio in this version slightly differs at 60 fat 35 protein and 5 carbs

a typical meal plan on the standard keto diet would look like the following

breakfast bacon eggs and tomatoes lunch chicken salad with olive oil and cheese dinner steak and eggs with a side salad or a bunless burger with bacon egg and cheese

now this sounds great  who wouldnt want to quickly lose weight while enjoying steak cheese and butter

unfortunately its not as simple as that

theres a reason why doctors aim to pull diabetics out of ketosis when they accidentally enter into the metabolic state

we spoke to jamie lloyd a british kettlebell champion biosynergy ambassador personal trainer and holistic health coach to find out more about this uberpopular diet

jamie told daily star online if you want to lose the belly quickly this diet will work but theres lack of research to prove what the longterm side effects are

theres also a lack of definitive research proving that keto is safe and effective for the longterm dieters

this is true of many newly created or branded diets as the longterm effects usually cant be quantified until around a decade after someone first tries them

jamie continued what we do know is this contains a highfat moderateprotein and verylowcarb diet has a reputation for being challenging especially if youre doing it without any proper medical guidance

plus when you ditch the plan you might undo all the work and gain the weight you lost so doesnt work

this means that while you might quickly lose that last half a stone its possible that youll regain it  and more as soon as you revert to a normal moderatecarb diet

jamie added also for all the buzz about the health benefits in the media so many people forget about the negatives  as most people binge on bacon and eggs they dont eat enough greens

this puts them in line for having a heart attack

the fitness expert reminded everyone to make sure theyre eating enough nutritious and delicious vegetables so that they dont deprive themselves of necessary fibre

jamie has over 17 years experience in helping people lose weight and is available for 121 coaching

in a note of warning he said remember always consult your gp before making changes to your diet

also once youve hit your target weight follow a balanced diet thats packed full of vitamins and minerals  or before you know it you will be hitting the wall

get your exercise in too and train smart if you want to look after yourself and maintain your weight after dieting

finding a parking spot on third street in downtown wausau can prove tricky

a lack of access to immediate nearby parking was a concern for adam jamgochian owner of ciao restaurant downtown he has existing customers from his old restaurant michaels supper club in rib mountain who might be older and accustomed to walking only a short distance to the restaurants front door he said

so he set up a valet parking program on third street in front of ciao the citys capital improvements and street maintenance committee approved a pilot program for the valet parking in january allowing it to continue for six months then the committee will evaluate how its working and decide whether or not to extend permissions by amending the citys parking ordinance

the valet service operates from 5 pm to about 10 pm on thursday friday and saturday evenings jamgochian said the valet company zenith hospitality group from madison blocks off two parking stalls on third street near ciao if you use the service the company reparks your car in a mall garage and returns it when youre ready to leave

jamgochian said they try to use one of the 15minute parking spots near ciao and the space next to it

if youre using the valet service to go to ciao whether for dinner or just a drink it will cost you 5 you can also use it to go elsewhere downtown like the grand theater but it will cost you 10

the new lemongrass asian fusion restaurant is also using the valet service for its customers jamgochian said

on average about 20 people a night use the valet to have their cars parked jamgochian said the valets busiest night was valentines day when around 30 people used the service

antonio conte admitted that christian eriksen needs to find the right fitness levels after making his first inter milan start following his move from tottenham

eriksen was hauled off after only 58 minutes on sunday against udinese before romelu lukaku scored a brace to fire inter to a 20 victory to keep up their serie a title charge

it was the danish midfielders second appearance since joining from tottenham in a 17million deal with eriksen making his debut off the bench against fiorentina in the coppa italia last week

christian eriksen made his first inter milan start during the 20 win against udinese on sunday

and following sundays victory which leaves inter just three points off leaders juventus conte admitted that eriksen needs time to settle into life in italy

i think that for someone who arrived five days ago and we should not forget we had to rush him in because we were missing several midfielders eriksen still made a positive impact conte told sky sport italia

obviously he needs to get settled into our style of football and also find the right fitness levels for serie a but i am very pleased with his full debut

he will get to learn the positioning we ask of our midfielders but these are early days and i am satisfied

eriksen joined the serie a outfit in the january transfer window as he looked for a new challenge away from north london after seven years with the club

the 27yearold midfielders contract with tottenham was set to expire in june but the dane refused to sign a new deal before holding out for a move to inter

inter boss antonio conte admitted the danish midfielder needs to find the right fitness levels

and spurs boss jose mourinho recently revealed that eriksen told him on his first day at the club that he had no intention of staying

the day i arrived he told me he was not going to sign said mourinho christian told me the decision was made and there was no way from that moment i was just trying to build the team without him that was the reason why i didnt play him many many times

it was down to me and mr levy to manage the situation in an intelligent way for me to try to have a player without great motivations but with a good sense of professionalism to give us what he could and for mr levy to do a great deal with six months on his contract

christian was a good guy in the dressing room always positive and always respectful with the limitations of somebody that wants to leave because there are always limitations in this situation you could feel in some matches he was not christian that is normal

former manchester united striker romelu lukaku scored a brace for inter against udinese ; liverpool have no fresh injury concerns ahead of their champions league clash with atletico madrid jürgen klopp has confirmed

a 21man reds squad departed merseyside on monday afternoon bound for spain with the first leg of their last16 tie to take place at estadio metropolitano on tuesday

and klopp reported on board the team flight that all the players he had at his disposal for the weekend win at norwich city are in contention to face diego simeones side xherdan shaqiri and nathaniel clyne remain sidelined

good exactly the same all on board and available cool the boss told liverpoolfccom when asked how the squad is looking fitnesswise

the fact the match in madrid comes just three days after the victory at carrow road will not be a factor in klopps decisionmaking process regarding selection meanwhile

the manager said no there are similarities in terms of system between norwich and atletico so the norwich game was i would say really good preparation for the game but atletico is a very physical team very well organised and all that stuff counterattack a lot of individual quality good setpieces

its not a massive turnaround its just the job to do and we like that thank god we are kind of used to that meanwhile and we are really looking forward to it ; braintree  the pastoral centers bethany chapel was full to capacity as cardinal seán p omalley led the celebration of ash wednesday mass on feb 26

cardinal omalley delivered his homily before the distribution of ashes looking at the reading from matthews gospel in which jesus talks about prayer fasting and almsgiving the cardinal spoke about the importance of motives that prompt religious acts

the pharisees were great at public prayer fasting and almsgiving but it was more a case of spiritual oneupmanship than an act of penance jesus is urging us to look at our motives and to avoid temptation to do religious acts in order to increase our prestige cardinal omalley said

he said that the human tendency to keep up appearances can undercut the true purpose of religious acts which is to grow closer to god

acts of piety have to be done with the proper inner attitude or they dont adhere to their purpose and our only real reward will be the passing notice of people rather than growing closer to our god he said

he spoke about how lent can be reduced to a time of setting healthrelated goals such as improved diet or increased exercise

these acts of discipline can be spiritually beneficial if they help us to overcome our selfindulgence and unhealthy behavior but the success of our lent cannot be measured by the number of pounds we lose or how many steps we take each day cardinal omalley said

he suggested that fasting be coupled with almsgiving using the resources that would go toward ones own comfort to instead help the poor he also said that lent is a good time to examine ones prayer life and seek reconciliation in relationships

in closing cardinal omalley explained the symbolism of the ashes which betoken the fragility of life and the sign of the cross which indicates that the dust has been redeemed by the loving sacrifice of jesus christ

ash wednesday is not meant to be a morbid reflection on death but a serious reminder that life is always short and we must be good stewards of the time talent and treasure that we have received he said ; save 30 and get automatic workouttracking heartrate monitoring and more

the galaxy fit offers a surprisingly robust set of features compared with budget fitness trackers of the past for one thing it includes heartrate monitoring  and can even notify you if it detects an irregular heartbeat it also automatically detects activity and starts logging it it even detects the type of activity walking running cycling and so on

ill pause here to note that my apple watch can do likewise  but its crummy at it it often takes 510 minutes before i get the it looks like youre doing suchandsuch notification and if i forget to manually end the activity when im done the results get totally skewed

i cant say firsthand whether the galaxy fit does a better job but cnets scott stein can in his comparison of the galaxy fit to the fitbit inspire hr he noted the following i also like samsung fitness devices automatic tracking of walks and workouts and how the stats instantly appear onscreen on a brisk walk im suddenly in workout tracking mode without doing anything

speaking of the inspire hr currently 7995 in case youre comparing its quite similar to the galaxy fit but with one key difference the latter has a color amoled screen

that screen is on the small side of course which can make notifications and other text difficult to read while exercising battery life is rated at up to five days though expect less if you set the fit to do frequent heartrate monitoring

i think the benefits here far outweigh a few small negatives for 69 youre getting a very capable fitness tracker that among other things will remind you to get off your duff cheaper than a bypass people

your thoughts

note originally published yesterday removed bonus deal due to erroneous product information ; one day recently i gazed into our bathroom mirror and saw someone i didnt recognize

me

not metaphorically actually literally

i could see under my remaining layers of fat and skin a chiselled physique beginning to emerge

i stood there gazing and even tightening my core and upper body each time i did my outer skin would tighten revealing a muscular frame that now suddenly lies not far below the surface

holy crap i thought im kinda jacked

those are actually the words i thought in that moment

for context please understand that this has been a very long time coming in late 2006 i weighed 330 pounds and very little of it was muscle

i recall the first trainer i ever worked with way back in 2007 telling me that it could take 10 years to achieve the kind of results where i could see true definition on my frame

i also recall my current trainer farr ramsahoye telling me early on that results would not come quickly or easily but that they would come

here i am more than a decade later and i can see the results of literally thousands perhaps tens of thousands of hours of hard work and dedication at the gym

and while my weight hasnt shifted greatly  i fluctuate between 290 and 315 pounds routinely  my strength and physique have shifted greatly

the mirror told me a great story that morning

i stood there and gazed that day my mind wandering back to some of those early sessions with farr when he had me doing simple tasks like balancing on one foot or working on my legs or mobility

at the time i wondered how any of that work  which seemed slow and arduous but not entirely conducive to a great physique  was helping me get stronger

slowly however farr cured me of many of my chronic injuries knee lower back rotator cuff and elbow pain to name some

farr is the human equivalent of a mechanic much like a classic car enthusiast who might buy an old beater and restore it to its glory farr took an aging former amateur athlete and restored him to his glory he does so meticulously with purpose and confidently he truly is a master of his craft

as i looked in the mirror that morning proud to be standing there barechested i thought about all that i have achieved at the gym im wearing size 38 pants i was a 44 when this started my chest and shoulders are defined and strong im benching more weight than i ever have painfree to boot my legs are strong defined and healthy my mobility is incredible for a nearly 44yearold and halfway through my life i can stand in front of a mirror and be proud of my physique

i dont know if anyone needs to read this but ill write it anyway keep going the results will come trust me and when they do stop and take a good look at yourself in the mirror

jan murphy is the former news and features editor for the whigstandard he can be reached at janmurphy2010gmailcom ; former unlv athlete chase skenandore does pushups to demonstrate the new outdoor fitness court by the national fitness campaign on tuesday jan 28 2020 at bill briare family park in las vegas ellen schmidtlas vegas reviewjournal ellenkschmidt_

maybe the comparison is unavoidable given that its just a hop skip and a jump away from the kids play area but the new fitness court at bill briare park sort of resembles a disassembled jungle gym for grownup kids

but it works because the new amenity is designed to offer a gymquality exercise circuit thats effective free and most of all fun for participants of all ages and abilities

the court was dedicated jan 28 the national fitness campaign which works to provide healthy outdoor infrastructure and promote healthy lifestyles contributed funding for the new court and counts las vegas as the campaigns 100th national partner

its the campaigns second fitness court in nevada  the first opened at hendersons cadence community in 2018  and campaign founder mitch menaged says fitness courts represent the latest stage of evolution of the classic fitness trail in which exercisers run or walk along a pathway and perform specific exercises or activities at each station on a fitness court participants work out in a smaller space performing activities in a circuit training setting

social fitness vibe

fitness courts have a smaller footprint than fitness trails so they can be built even in small parks and urban spaces atmospherically fitness courts offer a more social vibe than fitness trails do which menaged says is what todays exercisers seek

over time we started to realize  people like doing things in groups they like being social they like meeting people they like doing things together he says

fitness trails were a big deal in the 80s says greg weitzel director of parks and recreation for the city of las vegas but in recent years you see less participation on them

the reasons include a preference for working out outdoors and in a group setting weitzel says users today also like workouts to be programmed which at las vegas new court can take the form of either onsite instructors during limited hours or a free smartphone app that guides users in navigating its features

the fitness court at bill briare park 650 n tenaya way consists of stations dedicated to core strength and agility and activities such as squatting  pushing lunging pulling and bending 

whats great about this court is its all ability levels trainer andrea anzalone says

and its free

menaged says the workout also is a very carefully thoughtout system thats designed to be as good as peloton but designed for everybody and its free

malig williams lives about a mile from bill briare park and stops by several days a week to run on its trails he discovered the new fitness court before it officially opened

the initial draw was just the way it looks he says it looks very professional

then he began experimenting with the equipment and liked what he saw

im 42 ive been training since i was 19 he says im from hawaii and we did triathlons so ive been working out a long time

he prefers not working out in a gym because its too distracting and called the fitness court better than a gym

while the app is available for use anytime trainers are scheduled to be at the park at 9 am tuesday 2 pm friday and 530 pm wednesday those times likely will change as summer approaches

anybody who works out in a gym would appreciate this outdoor fitness court weitzel says not only is it free he says its all about connecting ; ousmane dembele has been tipped to leave barcelona this summer with the spanish champions open to offers according to journalist guillem balague

updated date feb 25 2020 170103 ist ; sioux falls sd kelo  the world of working out could be shifting from traditional gyms to boutique fitness studios these studios feature classes set to specific fitness programs in smallerscale settings and that boom of boutique fitness has hit keloland

accountability  thats what many people need to keep the workouts going

you get the text like hey where were you you cant sleep in on me megan kuipers a revolution cycle  yoga customer said

motivation  thats what many workouts center around

im an awful selfmotivator and i need that outer encouragement andrea oswald a define body and mind customer said

those two words are what have gotten andrea oswald and megan kuipers off of the treadmill at traditional gyms and into the booming trend of boutique fitness studios

ive lived all over and ive tried different gyms all over the world all over the country and the big box gyms just dont motivate me here i feel like youre getting motivation youre getting the encouragement on a daily basis that makes you want to come back oswald said

ive been to the big gyms the littler gyms working out at home and the smaller gym like this just feels more like a community you meet your friends here friends you didnt even know kuipers said

from barre classes and cycling to yoga and pilates boutique fitness studios have been popping up a new type of motivation to stay active in smaller more intimate settings right here in sioux falls

our classes are all rhythm based i hear from a lot of people that its the firsttime that theyve moved their body in joy they look forward to classes each day so yeah its a more personal experience an hour 45 minutes 30 minutes and the instructor is leading you and holding you accountable andrea oconnor coowner of define body and mind said

where a big gym you kind of go in you put your headphones on you do your own thing and you might not really know what you should be doing here were here for an hour 45 minutes 30 minutes and the instructor is leading you and holding you accountable oconnor said

its the variety of smallerscale classes that are unique to these studios

i think our clients love that they can show up and have an instructor plan the workout for them were all busy its hard enough to even get to your workout but you can show up and you have a highly trained instructor thats put together a really good workout thats wellbalanced katie twedt owner of form fitness said

boutique fitness studios also strive to give a sense of community to their clients

boutique fitnesses have been more popular because you find your niche you find people that are likeminded its not more than just a workout its also where you meet your friends you meet people that have similar interests with you that you can do outside of a bar or outside of a church braden bradfield owner of revolution yoga  cycle said

and for these studio owners the workout is all about letting their clients have a space to focus on themselves

i hope they leave and they feel like they accomplished something that they feel a little lighter a little better and kind of go out and spread their energy towards other people in their lives but for the 45 minutes or the hour that theyre here its all for them oconnor said

define body and mind is a franchise thats made its way to sioux falls while both form fitness and revolution have their roots in sioux falls those studios certainly arent the only boutique fitness studios making their mark on fitness lovers in sioux falls though ; finding an escape from the negativity of daily life locals head to f45 to release their stress

as iraq rages with protests and the death toll mounts a fitness revolution is happening in baghdads uptown karrada district

australian fitness chain f45 has set up shop in the city seeing an opportunity in an increasingly open and driven young population

the gym is carving out its place not only as somewhere for people to improve their health but also be part of a community

with so much negativity around us its nice to create something where people are able to vent and get positive vibes from a healthy environment yazen al timimi owner of the f45 branch in baghdad told the national

the usled invasion that toppled former dictator saddam hussein in 2003 opened iraq to the world after a quarter of a century of political and cultural isolation healthy living was never a priority for the country while was cut off from the international community

it was followed by years of civil unrest and conflict most recently a wave of antigovernment protests that has rocked the country for the last four months

but the surge in health and fitness clubs represents a sign that iraq is slowly emerging from the hardship

its a place where people can come in block everything around them and focus on their exercise and sweat out all the negativity mr al timimi said

f45 has become a mini community where people can come to and feel safe he added

although members come to the gym to relieve their stress there are some who come to train and then join the protests mustafa salam one of f45s personal trainers told the national

despite their daily encounters with road closures traffic and protests people are persistent to attend the classes he said

when we first opened people were surprised when they saw the gym because its a new concept in iraq mr salam said especially as hes been involved in the fitness sector for 10 years

since the early 2000s bodybuilding grown in popularity in the country and is practiced in more traditional gyms

but f45 differs from other types of gyms in the capital with upbeat music no mirrors on the wall and friendly hosts high intensity group workouts for both men and women last for 45 minutes

before the start of any class new members are introduced to each other with a round of applause

members have a lot of encouragement and motivation from us to help them improve their fitness level lose weight and maintain their health the 30 yearold fitness instructor said

but security remains to be an overall concern for residents across the capital some have let that get in the way of maintaining their health and fitness

mr al timimi says iraqis are resilient

some days where i hear theres been a bloodbath on the streets i think that no one will show up but i head to the gym and i see the classes are full he said adding that years of hardship have left people with a feeling of numbness

as the protest movement has normalised the mixing of men and women on the streets f45 has attempted to do the same with fitness

the training facility contrasts sharply with the iraqs cultural norms where women have seen their freedom restricted in recent years

the gym was not seen as a place for them with men and women traditionally training in segregated areas some gyms have designated womenonly hours

f45 is breaking that cultural barrier women and men are working out together comfortably in the same room mr al timimi said

the gym is on the expensive side however catering to a more monied audience at a cost of 150k iraqi dinar dh460 for men and 120k dh370 iraqi dinar for women

despite the positive start the gym has had mr al timimi says the countrys security situation and public services has already taken a hefty toll on the business

iraqs electricity sector never fully recovered from the damaged it suffered in the first gulf war the 1990s sanctions chaos and looting that followed the us invasion and the poor reconstruction efforts that followed  leaving it with frequent power shortages

our work out depends on exercises displayed on tv that is connected to the internet our music and work out videos are directly streamed from f45 so we are very dependent on electricity mr al timimi said

the gym has a generator as a backup in case of an electricity cut the set up was expensive from an electricity and internet stand point he said

nevertheless f45 members have found a way around the chaos of the streets and shortage of public services to ensure they never miss a class ; pep guardiola is confident aymeric laporte is ready to play 90 minutes against real madrid on wednesday even though the defender asked to be substituted during saturdays 10 win at leicester

laporte was replaced by nicolas otamendi after 57 minutes of saturdays match his third appearance since his return from a long layoff with a knee injury

guardiola said there was no fresh injury problem for the frenchman but the pace of leicesters attack was a tough test for a player still rediscovering his rhythm

he asked me to be subbed guardiola said hes not injured we cannot forget he has been out for four or five months injured they run a lot jamie vardy kelechi iheanacho harvey barnes they are all so fast

it was quite different against west ham on wednesday where there was only one striker so it was easier to control but hes ok

asked if laporte was ready to play the full match in the champions league last16 firstleg clash at the bernabeu guardiola said yes

laporte has made a gradual return to action from the knee injury suffered against brighton on august 31

he played 78 minutes against sheffield united on january 21 but then did not appear again until wednesdays 20 victory over west ham completing 65 minutes at the etihad

city have not conceded a goal while laporte has been back in action and guardiola will be keen to have his best defender on the pitch for as long as possible against madrid ; new york cbsnewyork  one fitness studio is giving hot workouts the cold shoulder putting into practice that exercising in frigid temperatures could actually burn more calories

princess sutherland is not a coldweather person but despite that shes trying something new a workout class where the thermostat is set to a chilly 50 degrees reports cbs2s michael george

it was out of my comfort zone i said let me try that she said

the class is called brrrn  with an emphasis on the brrr  offering high intensity in low temperatures

the theory is that working out in the cold is more refreshing and can help you burn more calories says cofounder jimmy t martin

our whole thesis is that we want you to sustain a higher intensity for a longer period of time and cooler temperatures do that for you he said

instructors say the frigid temperatures also trigger the bodys metabolism to keep you warm

if you dont have a class like this in your neighborhood there are still some ways you can get all the benefits of a coldweather workout

you can go for what we call a shiver walk so like dress with light layers go for a walk around your block do some calisthenics said martin

after her first try princess says shes convinced

it was just high intensity from the start she said it felt better breathing in there and it just feels refreshed when you stopped working out

experts say exercising outside in cooler weather can also boost your mood and immunity during cold and flu season ; the 31yearold has been sidelined since august when he suffered a serious knee injury during the canaries league cup defeat to league two outfit crawley town

after a six month injury layoff klose is hoping to boost daniel farkes central defensive options by returning to the fold quicker than anticipated

the injury is at its final stage and were looking at around a week and then im hopefully fully back with the squad and ready to go out there again and compete he explained

its a great feeling to be out there again and running around with no pain anymore its been a long time about six months now in total

they told me that it could be an end of the season thing but im happy i came back faster and im looking strong fit and im looking forward to going out there again

klose was a major protagonist in the opening half of citys titlewinning championship campaign before a less severe knee injury halted his progress

speaking after a signing session at the clubs fan hub at jarrold intersport in norwich city centre on friday klose revealed his spell on the sidelines has been difficult to process mentally

the start was very hard because i had a lot of plans i wanted to show everyone after the halfseason i had in the championship when i already struggled with my knee that im back fit again and i sorted the knee out and then unfortunately there was another injury to it he said

i played pretty much every game until january last year and then all of a sudden i had this stuff with my knee it started last year actually

then you get promoted and youre looking forward to playing in the premier league and then you get benched or sidelined thats hard you see the team out there fighting for every point and you want to help

farke has seen his defensive options limited due to reoccurring injuries to his key operators christoph zimmermann is the latest injury concern for city with the towering german a major doubt for the canaries trip to wolves tomorrow 2pm kickoff with a hamstring injury ; arsenal will see january signing pablo mari start for the u23s side when they face chelsea at meadow park on monday night

as per bbc sport the 26yearold joined the gunners on an initial loan deal until the end of the season from flamengo although there is an option to buy him in the summer

see more photo alexandre lacazette hits back at the haters following arsenal win over newcastle

in order to convince arsenal to make his switch permanent mari will be itching to get a chance to impress mikel arteta but hell continue his bid to prove his fitness with an outing for the u23s side first

as noted by arsenal in their prenewcastle medical update the defensive ace was in full training last week as he looks to get his sharpness back to be ready to feature in the premier league although it was suggested that he is likely to be make his senior debut against olympiacos in the europa league on thursday night

with that in mind his run out on monday for the u23s could be crucial in proving to arteta and the coaching staff that hes ready to go for the senior side and so hell be looking to impress with rob holding partnering him in central defence in what looks like a solid backline on paper

time will tell how he fares but getting minutes under his belt as well as adjusting to the speed tempo and physicality of the english game again will no doubt do him good given his lack of playing time in recent weeks and his lack of opportunities in his previous spell in england with manchester city ; rochdale v coventry city match preview  the sky blues are back on the road again this weekend in league one as they make the trip north to take on struggling rochdale

mark robins looks set to have a fully fit squad at his disposal for coventry citys game with rochdale

the sky blues go into the game 10 unbeaten and having won their last four in league one climbing into the automatic promotion places in the process

city make the trip north to a rochdale side struggling at the wrong end of the table and with one win in their last six

rochdale have just four league wins at home from their 14 fixtures so far this season

robins revealed there was a bout of illness in the sky blues camp in the buildup to this game but that everyone should be in contention

the city boss made three changes for the 20 win against southend united on saturday and looks like he could have the luxury to do so again this weekend if he so wishes

everyone is ok robins said at his prematch press conference

there was a bit of illness but apart from that it has been a good week

there are a lot of players pushing for places and behind that there are others trying to push themselves into the squad

all players are pushing to play and theyre all focused and thats great for me

we have tough games coming up but brilliant games to look forward to ; by 2017 however 147 of the study participants had suffered a heart attack or developed angina conditions caused by narrowing or blockage of heart arteries

more investigation showed that the risk of heart attack and angina steadily declined as cardiorespiratory fitness increased

we found a strong link between higher fitness levels and a lower risk of heart attack and angina pectoris over the nine years following the measurements that were taken said bjarne nes of the cardiac exercise research group cerg at the norwegian university of science and technology in trondheim

even among people who seem to be healthy the top 25 percent of the most fit individuals actually have only half as high a risk as the least fit 25 percent he said in a university news release

the study used a fitness calculator developed at cerg which measures the bodys capacity to transport and use oxygen during exercise it found that for each increase of 35 fitness points the risk of heart attack and angina decreased by 15 percent

the findings suggest that even a small improvement in cardiorespiratory fitness can benefit heart health the researchers said

the study was recently published in the european heart journal

study first author jon magne letnes said our results should encourage people to use training as preventive medicine a few months of regular exercise that gets you out of breath can be an effective strategy for reducing the risk of cardiovascular disease letnes is a doctoral candidate in the universitys department of circulation and medical imaging

sanjay sharma a leading expert in sports and heart disease wrote an editorial that accompanied the study

there is apparently no upper limit for training when it comes to the beneficial effects for the heart sharma wrote in addition to serving as medical director of the london marathon he is a professor of cardiology at st georges university of london ; this sleek new workout machine uses sensors to map your body in 3d and tell you when youre doing squats lunges or any exercise move wrong

athome fitness has become a hot category in the last few years thanks in part to the rise of peloton and mirror unlike the bulky fitness machines of the 90s remember the bowflex these pieces of equipment are designed to be part of your decor and try to bring the experience of working out at a fitness studio into your own home in fact when its not on mirror looks just like a fulllength mirror  you wouldnt know that it has a builtin screen where you can take a fitness class

similar to mirror tempos sleek design is meant to blend into your home  it looks like an industrial bookcase and a tv had a baby in a good way but what sets it apart is that it uses motion sensors and infrared light to map your body similar to the naked labs body scanner analyze your form and record every rep if your form goes astray during your workout youll see an alert on the screen with feedback on how to correct it

tempo officially launches feb 26 for preorders and itll start shipping in the summer the full system includes dumbbells a barbell weight plates barbell collars a heart rate monitor workout mat and foam roller the equipment allows you to lift weights from 75 pounds all the way up to 100 pounds and using the 42inch touchscreen you can participate in both live and ondemand hiit strengthtraining and movement basically yoga classes

the system costs 1995 and theres a 39 monthly subscription to access all of the workout classes and plans but you only need to put down a 250 deposit if you want to order it now i got to try it out ahead of the launch and i was impressed by how well it worked to count my reps and the immediate feedback about y form it gave me during my workout

form is imperative in weightlifting  if youre struggling to complete a move with proper form you could be using too much weight and be putting yourself at risk of injury the inverse isnt great either because if a move is too easy and youre moving too quickly through it your weight is too light and youre not getting an effective workout

the only way to be sure your form is perfect is to exercise with a trainer who can watch your every move but tempo is trying to replicate that experience as close as it can using both reallife fitness trainers along with sensors and ai every time you work out tempo checks your form during each move and alerts you if its not hitting the mark but during a live class the trainers can see each person participating in the class and get those same alerts they can then offer additional coaching to that specific person or provide general feedback if several people are struggling

in practice the feedback worked really well i tried out a prerecorded class where i did mostly squats and dumbbell curls while doing those moves tempo easily counted every rep and i saw the realtime feedback on my form both when i was doing it correctly and making mistakes

throughout the entire workout tempo showed me a robust dashboard of information that updates in real time telling me how many reps i completed my pace compared to the trainer and my heart rate it captures all of that during every session and uses it to map your progress overtime you can sign up for various fitness programs and tempo will plan out all of the workouts youll need to do to reach your goal

another feature i really liked is that tempo takes you through an evaluation when first you set it up so it can learn about your fitness level it then uses that data to customize every workout for you telling you how much weight you personally should be lifting and scaling that up as you get stronger

tempo and other smart fitness machines dont come cheap  a peloton bike costs more than 2000 and mirror is just shy of 1500 tempo comes in just under 2000 which is a lot for most people to invest in a home gym  especially considering you can easily work out at home with some inexpensive equipment and free youtube videos tempos following in the footsteps of peloton and mirror which despite their high price tags appeal to people who are serious about getting fit but dont have time to hit the gym

when it comes down to it these machines are status symbols in the same way the bowlfex was 25 years ago but having tried out both mirror and tempo i think tempo definitely has the edge because it provides realtime feedback that mirror can only do if you pay extra for personal training and while i dont think anyone absolutely needs tempo to get fit i dont think youd be wasting your money if you ponied up for it  especially if you want to lift weights ; batsmen temba bavuma and heinrich klaasens participation in wednesdays third and final t20i against australia at newlands in cape town is still in doubt

bavuma and klaasen have been sidelined by respective hamstring and hip injuries both are in contention for a berth in south africas squad for the t20 world cup in australia later this year

theyre going to be doing fitness tests so well have to wait and see what the outcome is hopefully its positive said assistant coach enoch nkwe

read nortje wants t20 world cup berth

rassie van der dussen and reeza hendricks have opened the batting alongside captain quinton de kock in bavumas absence

weve missed him but we have a big enough squad with good enough players that are flexible to bat in different positions added nkwe

we have looked at it as an opportunity to see which other players can adapt we know that weve got a world cup coming so we need to try different combinations

in saying that temba has been playing well so hopefully he will be back in the mix as soon as possible

the threematch series is locked oneall australia won the first t20i at the wanderers in johannesburg by 107 runs south africa triumphed in the second match at st georges park in port elizabeth by 12 runs ; scott mctominay is line to return to the manchester united squad for sundays clash with watford

the midfielder has been out since boxing day with a knee injury but could be back in the fold at old trafford on the weekend

boss ole gunnar solskjaer said i think he might be in the squad im not surprised hes got back so quickly because thats the type he is

hes a physical specimen hes a leader he never shirks a tackle and he brings everyone with him he can sit with nemanja matic or fred or he can be one of the runners in midfield

were talking about that today that we dont have that many runs past the striker he used to be a striker before so hes used to being in the box

meanwhile solskjaer believes anthony martials hunger to improve will make the frenchman a 20goal striker this season

life started with a bang following his bigmoney move from monaco to manchester in 2015 but the 24yearold frustrated after that breakthrough campaign due to his inconsistent performances

former united boss jose mourinho had been keen to sell martial but successor ole gunnar solskjaer put his faith in a forward that is contracted until 2024 with the option of a further year

that deal looks smart business 13 months on with the striker taking his tally for the season to 14 goals with a fine leveller in thursdays 11 draw at club brugge in the first leg of the europa league round of 32 encounter

solskjaer knows a thing or two about scoring for united and backed the striker to comfortably surpass his previous season best of 17 registered in 201516

i think anthony can step up get a few more and get to the 20 mark yeah definitely the united boss said having referenced injured 19goal forward marcus rashford

hes got quality of course hes a very good finisher he takes his chances really well good technique in his finishing

hes good receiving the ball at times and dropping off he can play almost like a false nine at times as well sometimes id like him to be stronger physically ; the gaffer was speaking to the media ahead of the clash with the terriers at the weekend

steve cooper believes the championship playoffs are still within swansea citys grasps despite recent stumbles in the league

the swans endured a frustrating seven days last week losing at home to derby county before drawing two winnable games against qpr and hull city

it leaves the club in 11th five points off the top six with just less than a third of the season yet to play the head coach is still confident of being in the mix ahead of the game against huddersfield on saturday

he said yes definitely reach the playoffs if we dont believe that we can win games then whats the point were not here just to play a part were a young team thats trying to play in a way thats hard but thats our way

its a looking forward mentality a we can do this mentality otherwise what is the point we want to win a game on saturday like we always intend to do we have to have that mentality and we do well get ready for saturday were at home we havent done well there in the last two games and we want to put that right

cooper also revealed the latest team news for the clash with the terriers revealing the huge boost that joe rodon is back in contention for the game at the liberty joe is back he was in training at the start of the week and has looked good cooper added ; surat female trainee clerks in surat municipal corporation smc had a rude shock on thursday morning after they had gone to the governmentrun surat municipal institute of medical education and research smimmer hospital for mandatory fitness tests

the women alleged they were made to stand naked in a group of around 10 women for a long time at the hospital during the additional gynaecology test which is mandatory only for female employees a few of the trainees also said that they were subjected to finger test by a female doctor who allegedly even asked unmarried women if they had been pregnant in the past

around 400 female trainee employees after completion of the threeyear probation period at fixed salaries of rs9000 are now being recruited as regular employees with full salary

as mandated by the state government in its recruitment rules for all employees smc sent its employees to smimmer for the test the tests which are underway for the past fortnight have conducted tests on more than 100 women in several batches till now

the male trainees too had to undergo the general fitness test which comprises eye test ent tests heart lung and overall body checkup

the women employees have raised the issue of the alleged insulting medical test to their seniors and even employees from across all the other departments of smc too voiced their objections on it

women employees in groups of around 10 were forced to stand naked together in a room that even did not have privacy the door was not even properly closed and covered only with a curtain the employees also alleged that the women doctors who were conducting the tests were also behaving rudely with them alleged a woman employee who was informed by a victim soon after the test

on thursday the smc employees union smceu submitted an application to the municipal commissioner and top health officials to take necessary actions and stop the inhuman test procedure the issue was brought to the knowledge of smceu by a few trainee women employees of the nearly 400 female trainees who will be regularized this year after hearing their trauma we demand an immediate halt of such insulting and inhuman tests i have never heard such a test on women employees anywhere else said aa shaikh general secretary of smceu

shaikh further alleged that the doctors performed finger test on the women who found it severely insulting as they had to undergo it in a group if they doctors have any doubt about the employees health they should get tests done in an acceptable manner asking even unmarried women about pregnancy in the past is downright insulting shaikh asserted

we have to examine women physically since it is mandatory as per the guidelines i dont know if such tests are done on men but in case of women we follow rules to find out if they have any specific illness said ashwin vachhani head of gynaecology department smimer

vachhani further explained that doctors check pregnancy details of married women to find out if she is pregnant at the time of joining since she may go on maternity leave soon after joining the office if the date of periods is missed women are checked for pregnancy even if she is not married he added

i have received a complaint of smceu it will be sent to the superintendent of smimer after proper inquiry they will submit a report to the municipal commissioner said a k naik deputy municipal commissioner health smc

when toi wanted to know if an employee who was found pregnant in the test will not be recruited naik said it is not that the woman employee will not be allowed to join if she is pregnant but as per the government guidelines of the fitness test it has to be done

a 45yearold female government employee said that she too had taken the fitness test around 20 years ago at the time of joining the government job i took the fitness test but was just asked if i have any gynaecology issue i dont recall any such physical test she said

i was recruited recently in a government job and had to take the physical test for gynaecology too which is part of the mandatory overall fitness test the gynaecologist examined me in a similar internal test a 27yearold fresh recruit told toi ; actor model and fitness junkie milind soman makes the hearts of every woman flutter each time he sneaks in on their instagram feed milind soman who is also a nature lover keeps on setting new inspirations and lifestyle goals now and then with his tremendous feats the latest pictures of his swimming in glacier water and fissure diving between two tectonic plates is beyond imagination in the pictures milind can be seen swimming in deep blue waters all padded up in a wet suit and swimming fins in one of the pictures as milind is prepping for the jump he flashes a thumbs up sign while fans have forever been in awe of this incredible man do keep an eye out for his social media updates if you want to stay up to date with his adventures ; realme is expected to start teasing the arrival of its fitness band soon

weve put together a small list of our favorite wearables from the fitnessoriented fitbit inspire to samsungs newest tizen smartwatch these devices are in no specific order

the original galaxy watch active was already excellent when it was released in early 2019 but samsung already has a replacement that adds minor improvements in almost every area

the watch active2 comes in two sizes 40 and 44mm and three colors silver black and gold plus a more expensive stainless steel version with builtin lte the regular 40mm model goes for 280 the 44mm version is 300 the lte 40mm is 430 and the lte 44mm is 450 not quite the bargain that the original 199 watch active was but there are some upgrades to justify the price hike like a new touch bezel and an updated software experience

the watch active2 can track your workouts manage notifications and use a limited set of apps while the health tracking on the watch active isnt quite as good as tracking from dedicated fitness wearables like the fitbit inspire its still good enough for casual use

our review reads the galaxy watch active2 is undoubtedly the best smartwatch you can use with an android phone its faster and less buggy than even the recent fifthgeneration fossil watches with better battery life than youll find on any wear os device  im not a fan of samsung raising the price by 80100 from the original model but now that the first watch active is already going out of stock at most retailers theres not much of a point in comparing the two

if youre in the market for a fitness tracker without any of the added complexities and reduced battery life of a smartwatch the fitbit inspire is probably the best option it still has a touchscreen display customizable clock faces and the ability to display notifications  but with the allday activitysleepexercise tracking and compact design that smartwatches usually struggle with battery life is estimated at five days but that varies significantly heavy use can bring it down to as low as two days

theres also an upgraded model the inspire hr which adds 247 heart rate tracking 15 exercise modes guided breathing sessions and more the base model can be purchased for just 60 and the inspire hr is 100

if you prefer googles smartwatch operating system fossils lineup of fifthgeneration smartwatches is as good as it gets all models offer 5 atm water resistance google pay support dedicated gps 1gb of ram 8gb of internal storage a 128inch amoled screen and a speaker

while the fossil gen 5 does offer some health tracking its not quite as good as the galaxy watch active2s abilities or the functionality you would get from a dedicated fitness tracker wear os does offer more applications any other smartwatch platform though  including google assistant

our review reads the fossil gen 5 is the best wear os smartwatch currently available unless lte connectivity is a requirement for you it doesnt suffer from lag and major bugs like many other watches though theres still the occasional sorry i didnt understand that from google assistant the battery life is enough for at least one heavy day of use and if youre going to be away from a charger for a few days the extended or timeonly battery modes can push the watch a bit farther

garmins smartwatches lean more into being a good fitness tracker than a good smartwatch but the vivoactive is the companys best attempt yet it comes in two sizes 40mm and 45mm with 7 and 8 days of battery life in smartwatch mode respectively

the vivoactive 4 includes gps tracking health monitoring animations for workouts so you can tell what exactly you should be doing customizable watch faces and the garmin coach assistant to help you train you can also download songs from spotify deezer or amazon music to play while you exercise

while we havent reviewed the vivoactive 4 ourselves the watch has received plenty of praise from other outlets wareable called it a top notch sporty smartwatch where fitness comes first while pcmag said its an attractive durable wearable that hits the sweet spot between fitness tracker and smartwatch functionality

if youre looking for a fitness tracker on the cheap it doesnt get much better than the xiaomi mi band 4 the 3040 price varies by region wearable offers an amoled screen health tracking notifications alarms timers music controls and so on it lasts roughly 10 days on a single charge as well

in our review rita wrote the mi band 4 is a nobrainer in terms of value for money however she noted that the swim tracking and companion app are both lacking compared to options from fitbit garmin and others

the mi band 4 is only officially available in china india and parts of europe however those of you in the united states can buy it imported via amazon ebay and other online stores

if you cant spend 200 on a fossil sport and you really want a wear os watch the tichwatch e2 and s2 are decent alternatives the e2 is priced at 159 and includes 5 atm water resistance and builtin gps the upgraded s2 model has a more durable design but also costs 179 neither watch has the latest snapdragon wear 3100 processor or nfc for google pay

another product in the ijustneedacheapthingtotrackmyhealth category is the honor band 5 we havent had a chance to review it ourselves yet but its already a popular option for its 25 price tag amoled screen and reliable tracking just like the xiaomi mi band its only available in the us through thirdparty sellers

the centreback is reported to have had a special face mask fitted so that he is not ruled out by the injury and has already trained with the team wearing the protective facewear

the news will come as a big boost to frank lampard ahead of saturdays london derby the defeat to united earlier in the week means the blues are still just one point ahead of spurs in fourth place as they both vie for that crucial champions league spot

having been in the top four for most of the season lampards team are faltering at the crucial moment as the runin beckons chelsea have taken just two points from their last four games with spurs united and surprise contenders sheffield united all making ground on them

chelseas achilles heel this season has been their defence no other top eight side has conceded more than lampards men shipping 36 goals in their 26 premier league games one of their main causes for concern has been set pieces and that issue reared its ugly ahead once again earlier this week as harry maguire headed home the second from a united corner

princess beatrice is set to marry property tycoon edoardo mapelli mozzi on friday 29 may the pair announced the news in september 2019 after edoardo popped the question during a trip to italy and details are slowly but surely coming to light what you wont have heard much about though is how princess beatrice will train ahead of the big day cue nadya fairweather her former pt

in 2010 nadya had the pleasure of training her dream client princess beatrice for her first marathon after which nadya told us all about her unwavering focus and determination and apparently a wedding requires the same kind of commitment

princess beatrice was the first member of the royal family to run the marathon

first things first decide on your goal training for a wedding depends on what you want to get out of it says nadya some train for stress relief others for weight loss others for feel good endorphins once youve got that in place its time to get started

nadya says theres one nonnegotiable that applies to all prewedding wellness regimes curbing the alcohol not least for its anxietyinducing properties likely exacerbated by the stress of planning a wedding but for its propensity to hinder motivation noone wants to get out of bed and hit the gym on a hangover its a small price to pay ahead of the big day

see davina mccall shares exciting fitness news with her fans

then youll need to impose a schedule brides to be should have a routine of daily activity which includes a healthy dose of walking plus anything else they enjoy nadya suggests the idea is that by choosing exercise you look forward to youre more likely to stick to your regime its also important to set short term goals this could be a weekly 5km park run or fitting in three yoga classes per week says nadya dont overwhelm yourself

princess beatrice will marry edoardo mapelli mozzi on may 29

as for choosing between different types of exercise nadya recommends pilates as an effective way of improving posture and core strength both vital for your wedding day when youll mostly be on your feet in fact fellow royal meghan markle previously credited her wedding physique to megaformer pilates a form of pilates using a machine to incorporate resistance training

see princess eugenie opens up about the stress of planning a royal wedding

hiit meanwhile might seem like an obvious goto for fat loss since its proven to accelerate heart rate and metabolism but nadya says to try and avoid hard core high octane training that puts a lot of stress on your system between confirming a guestlist choosing a wedding dress and deciding on a venue the list goes on youll undoubtedly be feeling the pressure and adding high intensity exercise into the mix will only promote cortisol stress hormone levels which may cause weight gain

yoga and meditation are both great alleviators a little bit of each every day will help affirms nadya trying to fit in a more calming routine before bed will also aid in a restful nights sleep

granted this all seems like a lot to fit in besides wedding planning and so you may want to consider inviting friends or family to join your sessions if you find time is limited train with your future husbandwife to be says nadya it will give you some quality time together and help keep you motivated towards the same goal training with friends can be a whole lot more fun than on your own too having someone to hold you accountable if you dont show up for sessions will also help keep you on track

many of us get out of breath just running for a bus and feel guilty about not going to the gym

but fitness levels could actually be down to how much you weighed at birth according to scientists

researchers looked at more than 280000 swedish men aged between 17 and 24  the years when they could be called up for military conscription in the country

on being called up the men underwent tests on stationary bicycles to test their fitness at swedens department for global public health

the findings show that for every 1lb 450g of weight at birth the participants capacity on the bikes increased by an average of 79 watts

this translates to a 34 per cent increase in fitness levels and a 13 per cent difference in risk of premature death the researchers said

coauthor dr daniel berglind said the difference he and his team observed was alarming

whether or not you are unfit could actually be down to how much you weighed at birth according to scientists

the average weight for a baby born in the uk is 7lbs 3oz and the nhs classified a low weight as anything below 5lbs 8oz

low birthweight babies struggle to feed gain weight fight off infections and can develop breathing difficulties

as they grow older they are also known to face a greater risk of suffering problems such as diabetes and cardiovascular disease

dr berglind and his colleagues wanted to see if low birth weights played a role for cardiorespiratory fitness in individuals born after pregnancy of 3741 weeks

cardiorespiratory fitness is the ability of the body to supply oxygen to the muscles during sustained physical activity

people who were born before 37 weeks  when they would be regarded as premature  were not included in the study

when the men in the study were called up to serve in the military their maximum aerobic performance was tested on a bicycle ergometer

the machine measures someones fitness by getting them to pedal as hard as they can for as long as possible

a persons v02 max  how much oxygen they can use during intense exercise is recorded in the test

the researchers found that those born with higher birth weights performed significantly better on the test

dr berglind said the 79 watt increase in output for every 1lb 450g of birth weight translated into a 134 34 per cent increase in metabolic equivalent met

what are the risks underweight babies face

the average newborn weighs about 8lbs and anything under 58lbs is considered underweight

low birthweight babies struggle to feed gain weight fight off infections and can develop breathing difficulties

as they grow older they are also known to face a greater risk of suffering problems such as diabetes and cardiovascular disease

in developing countries poor growth in the womb is one of the major causes of low birthweight

in western nations low birthweight is often associated with prematurity  a baby born earlier than 37 weeks gestation

low birthweight is often due to prematurity as a result of high maternal age

smoking medically unnecessary caesarean sections and fertility treatments can also all increase the risk of a baby being born with a low birthweight

met is a measure of how much energy someone expends during exercise relative to their weight the higher a met score the more physically fit they are thought to be

scores range from one to 12  where one is considered the equivalent of sitting on the sofa three is associated with walking seven with jogging 10 with skipping rope and 12 with sprinting

he said the observed differences were associated with a 13 per cent difference in the risk of premature death and a 15 per cent difference in the risk of developing cardiovascular disease

the results remained true even when researchers took body mass index  a measure of body fat based on your weight in relation to your height  into account

the findings stayed the same when the researchers compared the participants to their siblings suggesting shared genetics alone do not explain fitness levels

the researchers said the findings could impact public health policy because around 15 per cent of babies born globally weigh less than 5lbs 8oz 25kg

viktor ahlqvist who coauthored the study said providing adequate prenatal care may be an effective means of improving adult health not only through prevention of established harms associated with low birth weight but also via improved cardiorespiratory fitness

cardiorespiratory fitness is declining globally both for youths and adults according to a study published in the british journal of sports medicine

scientists at the university of essex found that from 1998 until 2008 there was an annual decrease in fitness among both boys and girls in middle and high income countries of around 08 per cent

there are also spiralling rates of obesity in children with the numbers of children who are morbidly obese doubling since 2008 according to nhs figures

how much exercise do you need to do

to stay healthy adults aged 19 to 64 should try to be active daily and should do

at least 150 minutes of moderate aerobic activity such as cycling or brisk walking every week andstrength exercises on 2 or more days a week that work all the major muscles legs hips back abdomen chest shoulders and arms

or

75 minutes of vigorous aerobic activity such as running or a game of singles tennis every week andstrength exercises on 2 or more days a week that work all the major muscles legs hips back abdomen chest shoulders and arms

or

a mix of moderate and vigorous aerobic activity every week  for example 2 x 30minute runs plus 30 minutes of brisk walking equates to 150 minutes of moderate aerobic activity andstrength exercises on 2 or more days a week that work all the major muscles legs hips back abdomen chest shoulders and arms

a good rule is that 1 minute of vigorous activity provides the same health benefits as 2 minutes of moderate activity

one way to do your recommended 150 minutes of weekly physical activity is to do 30 minutes on 5 days every week

all adults should also break up long periods of sitting with light activity

source nhs ; the leeds united head coach is speaking ahead of the trip to nottingham forest on saturday

marcelo bielsa has spoken in depth on whether or not new recruit jeankevin augustin will feature in leeds uniteds crunch match against nottingham forest

his decision to omit the rb leipzig loanee from the last two matchday squads has prompted a lot of talk among the fanbase and criticism from pundits especially to not have had the striker as an option off the bench in the defeat to wigan last weekend

it was the fourth time in the last five matches leeds have failed to score a goal each occasion ending in defeat

patrick bamford scored two goals as the whites came from two goals behind to beat millwall 32 but hes failed to score in six of his last seven appearances for leeds

its also been over a month since eddie nketiah was recalled by arsenal a stretch of five games in which leeds havent had an outandout centreforward available on the bench

follow marcelo bielsas press conference live here

leeds eventually did bring in augustin after he cut short his loan with monaco in the first half of the season but it appears to be taking time for the frenchman to get up to speed

bielsa stressed the importance of allowing the new recruit time to settle in at leeds before and after the wigan defeat and repeated that message in his prematch press conference ahead of nottingham forest

i have to give you a long answer said the argentinian responding to a question of whether hes happy with augustins fitness levels

augustin is a player with a lot of impact he has a lot of skills resources you can realise that with how much he cost and how much he was sold for and the teams he played for

but in the last eight months hes played three four matches so when one player in this period plays just three or four matches the conclusion about his fitness level is clear

if you see one team play wigan for example they sold their two best players one to milan and after the number ten why do you think thats happened and theyre fighting to be relegated or not

because of the economical fair play we dont take risks in this sense so you know perfectly that leeds cannot buy a player even if leeds would like to buy one player

so do you think one player with the background of augustin can arrive to our club if he is not in the situation where he is now because one player of his background with his skill with all the characteristics he has

if he was playing hed be a player worth 30 or 40m everyone knows that

so he arrives here without us playing that money because he has to resolve one problem which is that he wasnt playing

he has the skills and resources but you put that into one official match its not the same

ryan edmondson he played 20 matches in the under23 what i saw was never enough for him to be considered by me even though i watched every match and analysed to try to help him

in the last match he had a great performance and in this moment he injured his knee so you have the development the player grows and after you have the luck factor

bielsa then went on to draw parallels with the development of nketiah and jack clarke at leeds reiterating his disappointment in their parent clubs decision to recall him

i am very confident in augustins qualities he later added

he is a player with great great skills but in the art of football in a league like the championship which is the fifth or sixth best in the world he cant arrive without being at his best level ; going to the gym on a regular basis is already a feat but if youre busy and hit the gym on the way to or from work you need a place for all of your gear having a poorly made or flimsy bag can make getting to the gym even more of a struggle which is why weve compiled a list of great carriers that wont let you down pre and post workout

in an attempt to sharpen his fitness manchester uniteds deadline day signing odion ighalo has been taking double training sessions with great britains olympic taekwondo squad in manchester

the former nigeria international joined the premier league side on a sixmonth loan deal from shanghai shenhua with the chinese super league in the offseason

with ighalo consequently rusty having not played competitively in months he teamed up with the squad preparing for the 2020 summer olympics to be held in tokyo

more teams

performance coach wayne richardson who the forward brought on board to help with his fitness has been extremely impressed by the 30yearolds motivation to make an instant impact for ole gunnar solskjaers men

from the moment he ighalo has stepped through the door he is one of the few players who has blown me away with his determination drive and willingness richardson gushed

hes been doing double sessions and weve had to hold him back a bit and monitor him because he has fire in his stomach as a professional

given the timing of the ighalos arrival and with the injury to uniteds top striker marcus rashford the perception is that the former watford man has to hit the ground running promptly a fact not lost on richardson

solskjaers troops are currently in marbella on the newlyintroduced winter break and the fitness coach believes the onloan frontman will certainly be fit before the squads return if he maintains his unceasing effort

if we didnt have this break we would have been raising eyebrows richardson said

united are in a position now where they need someone now is there a right time or wrong time he might have to hit the ground running due to injuries

by doing these sessions he wants to hit the ground running and you can see that from the work hes doing behind the scenes

the 32yearold television personality admitted to suffering from low selfesteem during her teenage years

i didnt embrace my curves because i was so young simmons said at the time i had a little diagram and i would draw this big person and then  draw the person i want to be skinny and it was like i had body issues growing up i was concerned that i was fat i was like i just feel fat i always had that conversation i would cry about it

reiter said pool and her husband plan to renovate the house and live in it pool is also an instructor at jetset miami a pilates studio in miami beach the couple also have a home in massachusetts records show

puig said the deal marks the return of the beach house villa

traditionally i think a lot of people look at these properties as teardowns but for them it will be for their waterfront haven puig said

the rivo alto house last sold in 2016 for 425 million

a number of waterfront homes have sold for record prices on the venetian islands in recent years in december the founders of the skin care and cosmetics company m asam paid 1155 million for a spec home 120 west rivo alto drive

a month earlier in november developer emmanuel sebag sold the spec home at 802 west dilido drive in miami beach for 1555 million ; aymeric laporte played 64 minutes as manchester city beat west ham in the premier league

aymeric laporte says he feels fine after he lasted just over an hour in his second comeback from longterm injury for manchester city

laporte making his first appearance at the etihad since august had returned last month in the win at sheffield united but hadnt featured since

the influential frenchman partnered nicolas otamendi against west ham and impressed as city returned to winning ways in the premier league city restricted their visitors to no shots on edersons goal and laporte even tried to claim rodris opener as he poked the ball over the line at the back post

when kevin de bruyne had doubled the lead laporte was withdrawn for john stones on 64 minutes but he insisted after the game that there was nothing to worry about

i feel okay he told sky sports

it was a tough game because they ran a lot but i am happy with the result and with my performance

reflecting on his time out injured and citys defensive struggles without him laporte added obviously its difficult for me when you see your teammates suffering because you are drawing or losing

i want to give what i can do for the team and everything i can for winning the game and make a performance

de bruyne speaking alongside laporte was full of praise for how the centreback has returned explaining just how important he is to citys style of play

with the ball very confident he gives us options de bruyne said

hes been doing it for years and he slided in two years ago without any trouble and he helped us win two titles and win another championship

hes doing really well and i know when you are injured that long it takes time when he came back against sheffield united he had a good performance and a little bit of a setback

the way he performed today hes going to give us confidence and himself also because its a hard time being injured ; former hoffenheim sporting director ernst tanner has revealed a surprising story about liverpool star roberto firmino before he joined the bundesliga club

the reds forward has been a world class performer during his time at anfield having previously caught the eye in germany with hoffenheim

before that however it seems firmino didnt arrive with the most impressive statistics when he joined hoffenheim from brazilian side figueirense

its clear firmino has come a long way since then with tanner describing just how bad some of his fitness numbers were as they analysed his various qualities before completing a deal

you should have seen the data that we got on him when he was coming for the first time to hoffenheim tanner told bleacher report

in germany we usually do these endurance tests blood ones which are pretty accurate you know and he had the worst numbers i have ever seen in professional football

i would say to emphasise that he was even worse than my grandma you cant imagine

they were so low that you couldnt even believe that he was ever able to play professional football

he added everyone at hoffenheim was a bit curious about that at the time but i rated him pretty high because i was so convinced about his abilities and even more so by his attitude

considering tanners claims above its surprising hoffenheim ended up gambling on firmino in the end but it certainly paid off for them as he became a top player for them and will have earned them a very decent profit when he later left for liverpool

lfc fans will also no doubt be aware that the brazil international has only continued to improve under the expert guidance of manager jurgen klopp ; selftracking tools are not troubling per se  but having recovered from anorexia i know how damaging it can be to fixate on data

if you want to develop obsessive tendencies there is an app for that there are several in fact you may have downloaded a bunch of them on 1 january in a rush of resolutionmaking

fitness apps such as strava myfitnesspal and runkeeper can be useful tools for motivating you to start and stick to a workout regime but according to a study at the national university of ireland galway these apps can also encourage obsessive attitudes towards exercise the study which observed 272 cyclists who use strava found that people who predominately use the tool to show off  posting their workouts to receive praise for example  are more likely to develop an unhealthy compulsion and high stress levels

i mean this politely but duh it seems obvious that being able to track and share the tiniest details of your workout may not always be a positive thing i had an eating disorder as a teenager and for a very unhappy time data dominated my life i weighed myself several times a day i calculated everything from how many calories were in one bite of an apple to how many extra calories i would burn by exercising in cold weather i used analogue inbrain calculating technology to track all this had i had access to the plethora of health apps that are available now it would have taken me much longer to recover  not only because these kinds of tools enable obsessive behaviour but because they normalise and even glamorise it

the concurrent rise of wellness and selftracking technology has ushered in a sort of socially sanctioned technorexia we live in an age where you can never be too rich or too fit caloriecounting which was once considered bridget jonesstyle silly at best and neurotic at worst largely because it was coded female is now celebrated as a datadriven route to selfimprovement largely because silicon valley has coded it male it is harder to spot the symptoms associated with eating disorders when everyone seems to be fixated on their fitness stats also because eating and exercise disorders are still associated with women it is particularly easy for problematic behaviour among men to fly under the radar

as the authors of the strava study note the adverse connection between these technologies and wellbeing has received little attention only a handful of studies hint at the dark side of these devices a 2016 study of female fitbit users by cnn for example found that 59 felt as if their routines were controlled by their device while 30 said their fitbit made them feel guilty a 2015 study at duke university in north carolina found that tracking can reduce pleasure in the activity being quantified and make people do less of that activity when they are not measuring it enjoyable activities can become almost like a job by focusing on the outcomes of things that used to be fun noted one professor behind the study going for a long bike ride can cease to be a pleasure in itself but an achievement to boast about online

i am not saying that fitness apps are a bad thing i am sure most people use them positively that includes me now that i am fully recovered i find that trying to do 10000 steps a day is a fun nudge to get me off the couch however as healthtracking technology becomes increasingly ubiquitous  even kids use fitness apps  it is important to be aware that quantifying every aspect of our lives is not necessarily healthy

according to times now a fitness instructor in bengaluru was schooled by a middleaged man who harassed the woman over her choice of clothing the report says that the woman a fitness instructor along with her husband visited jp park a public park to exercise and shoot a video of her fitness routine

pexels representational image

while the woman warmed up her husband took off for a 30minute jog after getting done with her warmup exercises the woman took off her sweater and waited for her husband to return in order to start recording a video of her workout

apparently the middleaged man who harassed the woman was crossing the park on his twowheeler when he saw her preparing for her workout after parking his vehicle a few metres away from the couple the man walked up to the woman and started to harass her in the name of moral policing

according to toi he told the woman that her choice of clothing is not appropriate and that the park is a family place taken aback at the mans unnecessary confrontation the woman and her husband informed the man that she was not wearing anything that could be deemed inappropriate

twitter

however this did not go down too well with the man and he went on to film the woman and her attire and approached other women in the park to show them the same to make matters worse the fellow women in the park also participated in the harassment and passed remarks on the woman and her clothes

reportedly the woman has a relative who works with the womens helpline she told toi i contacted my relative who works with polices parihar womens helpline a few hours later i received a call from a dcp who apologised it is a family park which is why i felt safe to wear what i wore

pinterest

according to yeshwantpur police the situation was brought to an end by locals who decided to intervene no formal complaint or investigation has taken place since then

it is high time that people need to come to this realisation that moral policing anyone on the basis of their choice of clothing relationships way of life etc is immoral on its own and no one has the right to tell anyoneman or womanwhat to do ; louisiana rapper lil boosie was just trying to get a lil work out at the gym today but it looks like he was stopped at the door

however sanasie explained that it is customary when cricketers return from international duty they are to report to their territorial boards something hetmyer failed to do upon return from the ireland series

as such the guyanese was not considered for selection into the guyana team for the jamaica scorpions clash which began yesterday at the providence stadium

however sanaise cleared up the situation saying hetmyer has since reported for training and he is getting ready to redo his fitness test which is set for next friday ; tennis champ sania mirza has joined the list of sports celebs who bounced back in style after having a baby the sixtime grand slam champion who is mother to her 15monthold son izhaan mirza malik recently won her 42nd doubles title when she lifted the wta hobart international trophy with partner nadiia kichenok to get back on the court she had to regain her fitness level and lose weight over the past four months she has knocked off 26 kilos sania recently shared a picture on social media and expressed how we all need to take pride in our goals and follow our dreams no matter how many people tell you that you cant in an interview with bt she spoke her fitness goals focusing on the game and how she draws inspiration from her child to achieve her dreams excerpts

you are back to playing competitive tennis after a fantastic transformation what was the biggest motivating factor for you to get fit again

the biggest inspiration was to get back to playing competitive tennis but that wasnt the only reason i lost weight i needed to regain my strength and fitness levels i have always believed in being healthy and post pregnancy i did not feel healthy anymore it was never about my weight but how i felt i wasnt feeling good inside and that was the reason i embarked on this journey i started it a few months after my son was born

what kind of fitness regime did you follow was it tougher to get back in form after childbirth

yes the process was tough after you give birth you have to start from scratch being an athlete i am used to being fit and strong and i had taken my fitness for granted i got a reality check when i got on to the treadmill and found out that i could not walk for more than three minutes the first two months were extremely tough because i was not allowed to do core exercises and could only do cardio i did that for twoandahalf hours every day and followed a strict diet since i was breastfeeding at that time it was more challenging after i had lost 1517 kilos i moved on to weights and my core recovered i did not cheat on my diet for four months i stopped consuming dairy products gluten processed sugar and red meat i would eat spinach fish eggs chicken and continued to consume carbs whoever said that carbs are your enemy is not right they can be your friends too the initial days were tough and often i did not want to follow my diet or go to the gym and do cardio as it was boring however i am stubborn and disciplined too and so i was able to curb the temptation to cheat on my diet but the toughest thing was to keep off chai laughs i love my chai and i missed it a lot for four months since you have to look at the bigger picture and keep an eye on your goal all the cravings went away after the initial few weeks

now that you are focussing on the game what is your advice to sportswomen who want to get back on the field after becoming a mother

i feel anything is possible if you put your mind and heart to it being a mom is one of the most satisfying experiences of your life moms dont take a break i have learnt that from my mother i also feel that just because you have a child it does not mean that you cant follow your dreams if a woman wants to pursue her professional goals it does not make her a bad person or a bad mother in fact just like me all sportswomen should draw inspiration from their children to achieve more in life you can have it all

last year you took a break from twitter after the indiapakistan match during the cricket world cup did the trolling get to you

i think trolls are the biggest faceless cowards sitting behind desktops i feel sorry for them but mostly i laugh at them how can you continuously keep swearing and abusing people who you have never met if you observe a celebs social media account you will find that a certain section constantly hates them and i can only laugh at it because its quite entertaining i am amazed at how they find the time to vent such strong feelings towards anyone having said that i do take occasional breaks from social media as it can get toxic and it was no different at that point too during the 2019 world cup

your husband cricketer shoaib malik and you have to keep up with your hectic schedules as a family how do you manage to spend quality time with your son izhaan

my son is learning to walk and talk now he is at that age when he is learning new things every day and that becomes extremely entertaining for everyone in the house shoaib and i often spend time at home because otherwise we are constantly travelling whenever we are in dubai we enjoy walking and going to the parks because izhaan is a social baby being a mother has made me selfless i cannot express my love for him in words the only challenge i face with him sometimes is putting him to sleep at night since i am an athlete i feel sleep is important but if he is awake then i am awake too without my husband parents sister and my entire teams support i would not have been able to go back to my training and do what i love as they say it takes a village to raise a child ; its a good time to be a gamer  these amazon sales have opened up a whole load of new gaming deals this weekend were seeing plenty of xbox one ps4 and nintendo switch sales as well but theres also a roster of new and returning fitness tracker deals for those looking to leave the couch

the only reason we know about the problem though is that the state tests students fitness in fifth seventh and ninth grades and reports on the results thats why gov gavin newsom had the wrong idea when he called for suspending those tests for three years while the department of education examines whether and how they should be revamped

the tests measure various kinds of fitness such as strength and flexibility students run a mile and perform other exercises their body mass index  an estimate of their leanness or obesity  is also calculated

newsom has legitimate concerns for one thing students generally take the tests together its all too clear and can be humiliating when kids cant keep up on a mile run in addition certain tests have parameters for judging the fitness of girls and boys but those parameters are meaningless for transgender students and those students who dont identify with one sex or the other furthermore the tests are unlikely to turn students into fitness enthusiasts

but there should be ways to resolve these problems such as developing better metrics for the small percentage of nonbinary students without halting the tests altogether schools might need to pull kids out of gym class for smallgroup testing just as with math tests a students individual performance shouldnt be public fodder for conversation certainly students should never be weighed in front of others

but doing away with the tests wont help students true the body mass index known as bmi is only a rough tool for estimating obesity but it certainly can indicate that a second look is in order and parents should be aware if their children are heading for health problems cases of type 2 diabetes the type most commonly associated with obesity have been increasing among children

in fact the department of education should be taking a much deeper look at physical fitness programs and not just focusing on the tests todays gym classes arent bringing about the hopedfor results revamping them could mean introducing more activities such as hiking yoga and noncompetitive games that students might be more likely to do outside of school and throughout their lives were not all going to play on the football team but most people can find an activity they enjoy that will keep them moving toward better health throughout their lives ; a brandonbased franchisee of crunch fitness wants to significantly bulk up its footprint in the coming years with plans to grow to 100 locations throughout florida and the metro atlanta area

cr fitness holdings llc currently operates 21 crunch locations throughout florida and eight more are under construction by 2025 cr fitness wants to own 100 crunch locations

crunchs expansion comes at an ideal time for retail property owners who find themselves looking beyond traditional retailers for tenants crunchs typical footprint ranges from 20000 to 25000 square feet but it has locations as large as 45000 square feet said stacey mooney principal of the retail edge and master broker for cr fitness

beyond filling space in a shopping center crunch can also act as anchor drawing foot traffic to the property on a regular basis

the typical buildout costs of a new crunch location range from 2 million to 4 million and equipment is another 1 million to 15 million said geoff dyer president of cr fitness cr fitness has the financial backing to pull off its growth ambitions in july 2019 the group signed a deal with north castle partners a greenwich connecticutbased private equity firm that has a focus on wellnessbased businesses

a typical location has 60 employees most of whom are part time

the two categories exploding in commercial fitness today are the boutique concepts and the highvalue lowprice concept dyer said and the clubs that appear to be struggling are in the midtier price range

middlemarket gyms dont have the same price advantage of a lowcost gym or the competitive advantage of a boutique fitness option emile courtney of sp global ratings recently told bloomberg

crunch dyer says is flourishing because it has a wideranging demographic  25 to 70yearolds who are actively exercising each location offers group fitness classes free weights cardio equipment weight machines and turf and power racks  stuff for the performance athlete

dyer and cr fitness ceo vince julien acknowledge that theres a lot of competition in the bigbox gym realm planet fitness and youfit have been steadily adding locations

the difference with crunch is that they believe they can be all things to all people julien said

in their experience thats proving true  at least so far

the clubs have all been performing within 10 percent of each other julien said out of the first 25 weve never had a loser theyre all making money

these are the locations that will open in the first half of 2020 ; california law requires that students in fifth seventh and ninth grade be tested for fitness but gov gavin newsom wants to suspend that law for three years to study whether the tests may expose children to body shaming bullying and gender identity discrimination and that body mass index only measures for male and female

politico reported on newsoms plan

during a threeyear suspension of the test the california department of education would consult with experts in fitness adaptive physical education gender identity and students with disabilities regarding the purpose and administration of the physical performance test according to a proposal in budgetrelated bill language quietly released late last week

hd palmer spokesperson for newsoms department of finance said the move comes after complaints from parents that the test is discriminatory to students with disabilities and to nonbinary students since it includes a body mass index screening that offers only male or female options

palmer also pointed to studies that show bmi screenings play a role in body shaming and bullying

dispelling myths breaking down stereotypes and improving school climate is one way california is working to keep all students safe and healthy consistent with the governors commitment to a california that respects all students palmer said in the politico report given the body of research on the impacts of bullying on transgender and special education students during this period of suspension its important to take this pause and determine whether the current test can be modified or whether a new assessment should be developed

california has required the fitness test since 1996

politico cited one study from last year that showed that fitness tests have little impact on student attitudes despite the debate over their effectiveness

the website that explains the testing reveals the idea behind the test is to help children be active and in turn more healthy

the test has six parts that show a level of fitness that offer a degree of defense against diseases that come from inactivity the physical fitness test pft is a comprehensive healthrelated physical fitness battery of tests for students in california

the state board of education designated the fitnessgram as the pft for students in california public schools the test has six parts that show a level of fitness that offer a degree of defense against diseases that come from inactivity the test results can be used by students teachers and parents

the fitnessgram consists of six fitness areas aerobic capacity abdominal strength and endurance upper body strength and endurance trunk extensor strength and flexibility body composition and flexibility

politico reports that california school districts report the results tests to the state and that about 60 percent of the states tested students are in the healthy fitness zone when it comes to aerobic capacity according to the latest data from the california department of education ; by ushering in the new age sports and medical care hitherto unseen in india the countrys lone individual olympic gold medallist is helping improve the lives of people outside the sporting arena

what goes into the making of a worldclass athlete is a question best answered by abhinav bindra  through his cuttingedge high performance centres

he now wants people at large to put a premium on fitness and wellness

by ushering in the new age sports and medical care hitherto unseen in india the countrys lone individual olympic gold medallist is helping improve the lives of people outside the sporting arena

that is the need of the hour the 37yearold the brainchild behind the abhinav bindra targeting performance abtp told pti in a telephonic interview

the work that i have been doing revolved around prevention of injuries proper rehabilitation it revolved around well being and holistic approach the champion shooter added

daivam wellness indias first functional medicine centre has tied up with bindras abtp and asked about the collaboration he said this happened because of similar visions

it is very similar to what daivam really does like lifestyle  going to the route cause of the problem the philosophy is same

it is really the need of the hour what the people in the country need is meeting of minds between similar philosophy for betterment and well being of people he is trying to ensure the best global practices in either prevention of injuries or treatment of injuries are accessible to the people at large

sport is always the inspiration behind what we do we do a lot of work on prevention of injuries lifestyle related issues which has resulted in a lot of structural imbalances and the technology that we have allows us to make everything much more accountable and completely data driven said bindra

abtp has five centres  in pune new delhi mohali bengaluru and bhubaneswar

with technology we are able to employ assessment protocol which then allows us to evaluate what the imbalances are and then a customised programme is made he said

from back ache to rehabilitation athletes and people at large go to these centres

bindra says wellness is also absolutely important for sportspersons

an athlete is also a human being once we take care of wellbeing of an athlete then performance will automatically come an athlete is not a robot not a machine wellbeing of athletes is absolute necessary his real goal also is to go to the grassroots identify talent and provide them scientific training and rehabilitation facilities something he feels can help make a big impact in our performance

asked about awareness he said there is much more awareness than before we have to train the whole ecosystem and only when we take this to the base level we will start to make a real impact sanjay sachdeva founder  ceo daivam wellness is delighted with the association

as part of daivams journey to enable complete wellbeing in every persons life through the integration of various aspects of their life it is imperative to join hands with organisations who are equally in sync with this ideal as well sachdeva said

abtp was thus a natural progression and perfect example of a team that inherently has a similar objective and look forward to a mutually beneficial partnership ; law student malcolm brown centre with bow tie who alleges the law society of bcs entrance requirements are discriminatory is seen with classmates at the deans formal during his second year of law school at kamloops thompson rivers university via facebookmalcolm brown

the provinces legal profession regulator has changed its articling admission rules to remove questions about medical fitness including mental health a move the law society of bc said would destigmatize such challenges

however the change is an admission of guilt from the society says malcolm brown a law student who alleges such questions ended his dream of being a lawyer

and the rule change does not break a deadlock at bc human rights tribunal between brown and the society brown claims the questions have put his education back three years leaving him almost bankrupt

im happy to hear the questions are gone he said of the changes approved january 31 that is a big step that will help countless others the law society of bc is the main culprit who has been stigmatizing mental health from the top down in the legal profession in bc for decades and has an absolutely toxic effect on the well being of law students and lawyers in bc brown said in october

brown has not withdrawn his complaint though

and the society will not be stepping back from a case in which brown said the asking of the questions lost him articling positions asked if it would back away the society suggested it would be browns choice to withdraw the complaint

brown was in the final stages of his legal education with a desire to practice business or technology law hes wrestled with alcoholism spent months in a rehab centre and managed to get through most of law school with one brief relapse hes been sober more than five years

however to finish his legal education a final step is a practicum position with a law firm a position known as articling

and its there that he hit a wall with the process used by the society charged with licensing bc lawyers and overseeing their practices its that process that has now been changed by the societys bencher or directors

the benchers have taken steps to destigmatize mental health challenges and help current and future lawyers struggling with those challenges by adopting recommendations from the law societys mental health task force the society said in a statement

in reaching their decision to revise the application form the benchers determined that although the questions were wellintentioned in 2020 there are better ways to address the question of fitness to practise law the society said

other recommendations the society will embrace include collaborating with law schools to ensure continuity and awareness of resources for students as they transition from law school to practising law hosting a forum on mental health and substance use issues implementing a nonstigmatizing language style guide in society communications and conducting a voluntary confidential survey on mental health and substance use among bc lawyers

brown said the society was told to make changes in 2011 and has denied any discrimination against him

their defence is out of the window he said theyve changed the substance of the human rights complaint

the rule change came a year after the task force on january 20 2019 said it agreed with a president of the new york state bar association who said the hard truth is that stigma around mental illness remains a significant barrier to treatment within the legal profession and society at large there is compelling evidence that mental health questions on bar applications are ineffective and unnecessary and several states have already done away with them

the task force said fitness should be determined by conduct not condition ; have fun rewind as much as you need and dont take yourself too seriously

have fun and be patient

online classes can be done at home without the pressure of being in a big class  so have fun rewind as much as you need to get the choreography and movement right and dont take yourself too seriously its a learning process you wont see immediate results

make it a date

because online classes are done anywhere there isnt as much accountability to take classes regularly so have a friend come over and learn together at the end of the day dancing is most fun with other people

keep it up

the best way to get the most out of a choreo class is to take it more than one time just because you took it once it doesnt mean you mastered it it can take multiple runthroughs to understand the movements and build muscle memory get to know the choreo so well that you could perform it without looking at the screen ps look at yourself in a mirror dont be shy  youll immediately see what needs to improve

researchers at imperial college london have developed a new fitness tracker for pets that can read an animals vital signs animals wearables arent new weve been using trackers on livestock for decades but the consumer products on the market thus far have been criticized for questionable accuracy providing limited information and for being just another way that big corporations can make all the important things in our lives into data to be bought and sold

when it comes to ones specifically designed for pets do we really want to subject our cats and dogs to our neurotic stepsperday fitness obsession thankfully this new tracker is not so much about turning our pets into svelte running influencers but instead to help pet owners and vets monitor pet health according to the study

the problem historically with creating an accurate pet wearable has been fur wearables work by using sensors to track patterns of subtle movement like heartbeat and breath but its been hard to make wearables that get close enough to animals skin without shaving them which isnt very practical pockets of air and flouf between skin and wearable make it hard for sensors to detect vitals

wearables are expected to play a major role in monitoring health and detecting diseases early

instead of using the hard materials that human wearables are made of researchers made this pet wearable out of a siliconewater composite which is flexible the sensor works like a watery stethoscope filling any gaps between it and its subject so that no air bubbles get in and dampen the sound yasin cotur an author of the study and professor at imperial college told eurekalert

the wearable which is not yet in production for consumers uses gps to track movement and sensors to track vital signs but the developers are planning to add motion sensors as well this is important because if wearables are going to be used to measure our pets health we need to know not just where they are but also what they are doing eating standing sleeping or sitting one of the problems with past pet wearables was that they gave pet parents just enough information to cause concern but not enough to be helpful

the tracker is designed to address the flaws in previous devices by letting us monitor and respond to health issues more immediately than we have been able to in the past wearables are expected to play a major role in monitoring health and detecting diseases early cotur said according to eurekalert these sensitive silicone wearables could provide a useful missing link in animal healthcare the ability to communicate basic health facts if my heart is racing i can use language to tell someone who can help me but animals unfortunately cannot

i often wish stevie could tell me how shes feeling when she coughed the other day instead of frantically googling what the problem might be a wearable could have assured me that her vitals were fine and i might have chilled out enough to notice that she was just eating too fast

and if there were something actually wrong with my baby i would have had actual information to give my veterinarian instead of my usual blubbering paranoia having more accurate information from wearable could help pet parents and veterinarians alike become better caretakers of our fur families they may not be the fountain of dog youth but they may mean that we can help our pets live longer healthier lives ; one woman who attended the club said she had paid 300 for a yearlong membership just two weeks ago she questioned whether the club should have been taking new memberships if it was struggling

im sure this has been something they knew about for a while she said

another woman said that a week ago she paid 300 to enroll her children in the gyms spring swim program

i tried to call but didnt get any answer she said i want to see if they have another place but im not paying again

waters said she alerted her members by email jan 26 that the club  part of the community since 1977  had been closed

we have done everything we possibly could to try to keep this club operation viable and running the email reads

unfortunately with the everincreasing overhead and expenses required to keep the club running properly the financial viability of the operation is not there

waters said national fitness creditors have finalized arrangements with another club for members to attend those arrangements have been worked out with waters edge fitness at 11 lakeshore rd w so that national fitness members whose memberships have yet to expire will receive time credits at waters edge fitness based on that clubs rates

guy mcmurray who attended national fitness for 30 years and is now at waters edge fitness says the transition worked out well for him

while transferring to a new facility is an option waters said some members are opting to cancel their membership each scenario is being treated on an individual basis some people might have two months left on their membership some people might have six months left some people might want to go to a different location some people might not some people have personal training sessions so we are doing our best to honour personal training programs as wellultimately at the end of the day we dont want anybody to lose anything that they purchased she said

waters said she has been inundated with emails since the closure but tries to get back to members within 24 to 48 hours ; the honor magicwatch 2 is the latest range of smartwatch that seeks to immediately impress especially at its price range and specifications

apart from the umami flavour they add to dishes they are packed with healthy probiotics that aid digestion enhance immunity and improve gastrointestinal health

heres a look at how they should and shouldnt be used

miso

this fermented soy paste with a salty earthy flavour is what makes miso soup so hearty and comforting

it can be eaten raw or cooked but boiling makes it lose its beneficial probiotic qualities says sandhya pandey chief clinical nutritionist at the fortis memorial research institute gurgaon

also it contains high levels of sodium so it is advisable to limit its use

while it tastes wonderful in marinades sauces and batters to get the most out of miso its ideal use would be in a salad dressing where it is never heated to high temperatures and therefore retains the probiotic qualities that make it so healthy

mirin

the principal condiment in teriyaki sauce mirin is similar to rice wine sake but sweeter and with a lower alcohol content and higher sugar content

steam vegetables and fish with mirin or add it to marinades for a delicately sweet grilled fish or meat barbecue this is a flavour that pairs well with ginger soy sauce and sesame seeds says chef amit patra of the japanese restaurant edo at the itc gardenia hotel in bengaluru

while mirin is free of fat it is high on sugar content and therefore not suitable for diabetics or prediabetics says sweedal trinidade senior dietician with mumbais hinduja hospital

if it is being used in a family meal mirin also should be cooked on high heat to allow the alcohol to evaporate while its flavours remain mirin in salads is not heated and hence unsafe for children as it has significant alcohol content

tempeh

this fermented soybean cakes from indonesia looks like a burger patty and is often used as a meat substitute tempeh is fermented soybean compressed into a solid cake it looks similar to tofu but is a dairyfree alternative that can also be eaten by vegans

tempeh has a firm dry chewy texture and a nutty flavor that can lend meatiness to a dish its texture makes it versatile and it can be tossed sauteed marinated or added to curries says eric sifu executive chef with pebble street hospitality which manages the asian restaurants foo and koko in mumbai

tempeh is a delicate probiotic once opened it must be wrapped and refrigerated immediately leave enough space around it in the fridge as stacking will lead to overheating and undesirable fermentation which could spoil the tempeh and make it unfit for consumption says tenzin namkha chef de cuisine at the mikusu restaurant at the conrad bengaluru hotel

in addition to its antioxidant effects it is a great source of protein for vegetarians and vegans says trinidade

amazake

this sweet nonalcoholic rice wine is made by mixing dried rice koji see box with water and letting it ferment under very specific temperature conditions

because it is made from whole grain brown rice it is packed with nutrients says nutritionist hetal chheda it has active enzymes which break down carbs fats and proteins to aid digestion other key benefits include improved guthealth a boost in metabolism better skin health and improved immunity

you can have the beverage gently warmed and flavoured with fresh ginger on cold days in the summer have it chilled

amazake can act as a vegan substitute for milk in baking but drink in moderation says chheda it has a high sugar content ; sacramento calif  california gov gavin newsom wants to pause physical education tests for students for three years because of concerns about bullying and the test discriminating against disabled and nonbinary students the move also comes after annual test results show a growing percentage of students scoring not healthy

hd palmer spokesman for the finance department said the state has received complaints that the current examinations measurement of body mass index is discriminatory to nonbinary students a measurement calculated from weight and height bmi screenings require students to select male or female he said

annual state reports of the fitness test since the 201415 school year show a steady decline in the share of students scoring healthy according to a review by the associated press students scores have particularly dropped in the category of the fitness test that measures aerobic capacity  which can be tested in a onemile run or by other methods other categories also test for flexibility and exercises like pushups

in the last five years the percentage of fifthgraders scoring healthy in the aerobic category has dropped by 33 percentage points in seventh and ninth grades the drops are 44 percentage points and 38 percentage points respectively meanwhile the percentage of students identified as needing improvement and having a health risk went up by 33 percentage points among fifthgraders 44 for seventh graders and 38 among ninth graders

the education department did not immediately comment on those results

during the proposed physical fitness test programs suspension the state would study whether the current test should be modified or redrawn anew palmer said initiated in 1998 the school tests can include a onemile run pushups and other measurements

physical education classes would remain a requirement for graduation however

the proposal first reported by politico was tucked inside newsoms education budget bill for next year

school districts nationwide use such tests and the exercise can inform growing children about potential health problems experts say but the results from tests and bmi measurements should not be used to diagnose health risks according to the society of health and physical educators

the issue of bmi screening plays a role in the issues of both body shaming and bullying palmer also wrote in an email

bodybuilder and former gov arnold schwarzenegger had several school fitness initiatives during his time in office he said through a spokesman that physical education classes should be the top priority

whether the state uses fitness tests or not governor schwarzenegger believes that the most important thing is that our students have access to daily physical education classes to promote a healthy and fit lifestyle said daniel ketchell a spokesman for schwarzenegger

ketchell agreed that bmi screenings are flawed he said for instance that the 6foot2inch and 240pound schwarzenegger would have been officially classified obese when he won the top bodybuilding title of mr olympia in 1974 ; mahikeng  north west premier job mokgoro is not fit to deliver the state of the province address sopa the democratic alliance da said on thursday

caucus leader winston rabotapi said mokgoro was not fit to deliver sopa by virtue of the office of the premier being under administration which effectively strips him of his executive powers

subsequently this casts doubt on the legitimacy of the ten mecs whose departments are also under administration to deliver their budget speeches in the coming weeks

we regard this matter in a serious light and therefore wrote a letter to the speaker of the nwpl north west provincial legislature sussana dantjie expressing our concerns he said

the speaker undertook to have a formal discussion with us but failed to do so instead her office released a media statement last night confirming her satisfaction with the preparation for the official opening of the nwpl ; i want it to stop i fear for the next woman he is with it is unacceptable

a businessman who forced his exgirlfriend to give up her job and flee her home during a hate campaign after he wrongly believed she had cheated on him with a personal trainer has been ordered to pay her 300 compensation

heath speakman 49 left fitness instructor kate brooks 35 a broken woman after he hounded her in the false belief she had a relationship with a colleague known only as tom

speakman 49 who runs a furniture restoration business guilt tripped miss brookes with over 1800 texts wrongly claiming he had cancer and was about to commit suicide he even left a handwritten message on her car windscreen warning her he had been diagnosed with an std

the fatheroftwo was also accused of creating a fake instagram account in the name of tom and lifting his biographical details to hound miss brooks with messages and would use his own social media business page to post offensive messages on miss brooks keep fit blog

one included a message on an article she posted called the naked truth commenting wouldnt worry everyone has seen you naked

the victim from disley near stockport was so so scared of speakman she had to be given an escort from work by workmates and she moved in with a friend

police said he created five fake email accounts to harangue miss brooks from june to august 2018

last october speakman of st helens merseyside was found guilty in his absence of harassment after miss brooks relived her ordeal in the witness box

he was later traced and ordered to face court where he pleaded to the charge

at tameside magistrates court speakman was also sentenced to 14 weeks jail suspended for 12 months and was banned from contacting miss brooks for five years under the terms of a restraining order

he was also ordered to pay a 115 victim surcharge and complete 150 hours unpaid work

in a statement miss brooks said since i split up from him he has persistently harassed and tried to contact me by any or all communication channels using threats emotional blackmail intimidation and public social ridicule

his behaviour is erratic and irrational and caused me extreme stress upset and extreme anxiety im a nervous wreck and generally sick with it all leaving me a shell of a person i once was living in a constant state of stress not sleeping i truly thought i would or could have a heart attack or stroke

i took time off work due to him making threats to smash up my car  something he threatened to do many times when we were together and fell out i have had to tell work all that has gone on he joined the gym after the split and went very day to intimidate me and push me out

i have handed my notice in in case i see him passing i know he drives past work to see if my car is there im constantly looking over my shoulder i dont know what he is capable

his version of events and how he creates an untrue story from nothing is something i now know he will have done with other women he has been with he can change from nice to vile at the flick of a switch he is a controlling obsessive person this is how i now see him

i feel i have to check my phone as he created numerous fake social media accounts leaving abusive messages and comments on my blog and business facebook page

he has accused me of lying cheating and obsessed over a gentleman called tom throughout our relationship and to this day on going he started many vile and abusive arguments over me liking some pictures

i would stay at my sisters for days because they were nasty and scary he wouldnt leave me alone until i admit to cheating or lying

im going insane he would make me question myself and doubt my beliefs i now know the person i was so in love with doesnt exist and our relationship was nothing but toxic

with his record of failed relationships and patterns of behaviour throughout our relationship i should have seen it for what it was

i thought before i said or did anything i was always apologising unnecessarily for something i had no reason to apologise for he would make me tell him every detail of my past relationships and people i had slept with and bring them up to make me feel guilty

if it had not been for my sister taking me in after we split i honestly dont know how i would have got through this

just like he did when we were together he is chipping away at me even now i dont want to see or think about him again

it has been nonstop harassment erratic behaviour stalking and i want it to stop i fear for the next woman he is with it is unacceptable

prosecutor miss shazia aslam told the hearing this is a case where the defendant has sent 1800 text messages within two months with five to six email accounts and left notes on the windscreen when she was at work

she has had to move out of the area and quit her job this has caused quite a lot of distress and significant lifestyle changes for her

in mitigation defence lawyer adam bonney mr speakman and ms brooks were in a relationship for some two and a half years when it split there was talk of an sti which mr speakman believes he got from her he accepts there was a period where he was sending lots and lots of text messages and she responded for a period of time

for a long time he had admitted what he has done and he has moved on he had had a bag of clothes in his van waiting to deliver them to her writes a note warning her he has got an sti and got himself checked the last two months have been hard for him

but jp brian darcy told speakman we dont believe this is acceptable behaviour given the lengths you went to with 1800 text messages five fake email accounts to prolong the harassment the harm caused was very serious with significant psychological damage ; in the only 24 years that shaneka lambert has been on this earth shes spent the vast majority of that time battling with her weight let her mother tell it shes been pining for food in an unhealthy way since she was a newborn

my mom says when i was first born that she had to take me to the doctor because i wouldnt stop eating and she constantly had to keep feeding me she said from then i just kept eating and eating and just went up and up

by the time the bedford resident england hit 20 years old she reached her highest weight of 1606 kgs which is around 354 pounds her body at such a young age was already starting to give her trouble and the threat of diabetes and heart disease prevalent health issues in her family was looming

i didnt want my health to get to a place where i had like diabetes or where i would have something thats irreversible but i was at that point she said

so she got on a diet plan the uk version of jenny craig or weight watchers and after some serious dedication she began to see the weight fall off from there lambert started hitting the gym going from a strong commitment to cardio to weightlifting four years later shes since lost more than 165 pounds the key to making that happen was not warnings from other people but as she shared with us deciding for herself that she wanted and needed to turn her life around if she was going to truly get to enjoy it

we talked to the ukbased health and wellness advocate about her amazing transformation trying to embrace her body as she deals with loose skin and how she went from buying fast food three times a week at the least to picking a clean home cooked meal over a takeaway any day of the week

madamenoire how long has your weight been an issue is it something you battled with as a kid or was there a life event that caused you to put on weight

shaneka lambert no ive struggled with it all my life about four years ago i started having issues with my weight where my body was starting to hurt simple things like walking up the stairs was a struggle i started to find that really hard so yeah four years ago i thought enough is enough if i dont do anything now its going to be way too late at that time when i was with my boyfriend i wanted to have a child but they said i was too overweight thats why you dont get regular periods and all that stuff it led to this me wanting to do better

was there one specific catalyst that inspired you to make a change like you said you were considering having children and were finding these barriers in your way

my main catalyst was my health at the time the issues i had were reversible but if i left them and let them get worse later they wouldnt be my health would have deteriorated diabetes runs in my family and heart conditions are very high in my family on both sides i wanted to get things together before it was too late

also my parents were starting to get worried about my weight they were saying hey its enough now they started talking about it and when they did it hit me like i am really young and i should do something about it while i can control it so yeah i just tried and in the beginning it was very small weight losses then my cousin encouraged me to try diet program slimming world and with that thats when the weight literally started to come off you have weight watchers in america we have slimming world in the uk so my cousin took me to that and said try this out and see if it works for you literally that worked a lot i eventually stopped going to the slimming world classes and was carrying on at home by myself i adapted to the diet a little bit and i felt it was a bit boring eating the same things over and over again i was still focused on my diet though but then i started going to the gym ive been going to the gym now for about a year and a half but probably now doing weights for four months its been a slow process

so you had great success once you adapted to the slimming world diet and started exercising in different ways in what ways has weightlifting really helped to propel your efforts

i was getting loose skin and i thought i need to tone up properly before i even look into surgery to help with it i was advised to tone up with my dad saying i needed to tone up for at least a year and see where it can get me my skin was really really saggy and loose before but now its actually starting to tighten up its minimal but it has changed within the last couple of months so im going to keep going with it to see if it can help me before i look into skin removal surgery

youre sure thats the next step you want to take

definitely its not going to go completely and if it does still look how it looks now eventually i will want to look into skin removal its about finding the right person i guess

how do you go on this journey in the meantime then of trying to embrace your body in this new way and practice being kind to yourself when you are at the same time looking in the mirror and seeing this loose skin

im really trying to embrace it but literally my skin i find it so embarrassing that i will cover up this year though my goal is that if i post more pictures about my loose skin i hope i will feel more confident in myself and just start to accept it if i know that other people can accept it i can accept it so me taking pictures now and showing my skin difference and what it looks like i feel like it is helping me get used to it and know this is me i need to get used to this because all of my life ive literally been covered up ive never shown any part of my body now that i have thinner arms and thinner legs i do want to show my body but its just the loose skin im not too sure so me posting pictures and trying to like get me and everyone else to embrace my skin it makes me feel a bit more comfortable

what has been the very big as well as the smaller but still important change that has been most fulfilling for you

this is going to sound so silly but my major thing is being able to go into a shop and literally be able to pick up anything i want when i was bigger i had to order clothes from online because there arent many shops in england to just go out and buy clothes for bigger people now im just able to literally go to any shop even at the supermarket pick out anything and say yeah i want that and literally buy it thats a really big perk to me and a smaller one would be and i really took it for granted walking i never knew how i struggled so much walking i would go up stairs and be sweating and i really couldnt breathe but now i can run up the stairs and i do not take that for granted i appreciate it laughs i can literally run

im sure it was also hard to be only 20 years old and to already have so much discomfort just walking up the stairs

yeah it was especially hard because i work in a childrens home it would have four floors and i would have to walk up so many stairs to take all these kids by the time i got to the top i couldnt breathe i would have to stand there for five minutes to get my breathe back it was a lot it was bad

what efforts have you made to ensure that this is a longlasting or permanent change as you noted you may put on a few pounds here and there but what is in your heart and mind keeping you from regressing to where you were before because for many people food can be a crutch to deal with different things including emotions

i try my hardest to limit the unhealthy food that comes into my house when i do food shop i may have a few treats but i know not to buy too much because i will overeat so if i just stick to buying minimal treats that i like and have them once every other day or once a week then im able to stick to it easier i literally shop off a list and have to know what im getting and get out

for someone who may ask how would you summarize what the keys were to losing as much weight as you did

i would say definitely portion control was a big deal my portions used to be out of control because they were so big when i first started my weight loss i was living at my moms house and so she made sure my plates were much smaller than what i was having before i had to make sure that half of it was vegetables and then the rest were protein and carbs that was a big change because before i used to eat little vegetables i hated them i wouldnt really put vegetables on my plate to be honest but she made sure i changed my portions and added more vegetables to my diet

and then i realized i had to think before i ate am i actually hungry or am i eating because im bored a lot of the time i would eat because i was bored so i had to realize i would have an appetite because i wasnt doing anything so i thought do something first and if youre still hungry come back later and eat that was a big thing too because boredom eating is what i did a lot of also with the food side i started to eat less processed foods i would eat a takeaway meal about three to four times a week at least so id start eating more at home home cooked meals that also saved me money and home cooked meals are so much better than takeaway meals as well

and as far as the workouts

i would say literally its all about the gym when i started at the gym i did start from just being fixated on cardio but as it went on i obviously started picking up weights and trying classes but yeah i would say start with cardio to help you get into a routine i would do an hour of cardio of like 15 minutes on a bike 15 minutes on a treadmill 15 minutes on a rower and then 15 on an elliptical eventually i cut my cardio now im doing a fiveminute warmup with cardio and the rest of my hour or however long im there for im lifting weights im just trying to build muscle now because when i wasnt building muscle my body wasnt looking so toned up but now im starting to build muscle and develop more lean fat so its much better weight lifting has changed my body a lot

what is your advice to someone who wants to get started but theyre not feeling motivated or so sure that this time will be different than any other

you can not start unless you are truly ready to start and i know people around you will say you have to lose weight you should do this it wont work unless you are truly ready to do it for yourself thats the first step afterward realizing you want to do it and need to do it i would say focus on changing your diet first before you start doing exercise because i think the diet change and the nutrients thats a big part of the whole weightloss journey once you get your diet under control then work in the exercise diet is definitely one of the first steps to make a big change even small changes little things like portion control or eating at certain times of the day or drinking more fluids so you feel more full when you eat those are important little things make a huge difference you may think its not working but really your body is working it might take you a while to see it but you will eventually see it i eventually got down to this and im so happy its lifechanging it truly is ; the statistics are terrible  study after study shows children all over the world are weaker do less exercise and are less fit than in the past

in england alone despite a slight improvement last year fewer than half of five to 16yearolds achieve the governments recommended 60 minutes exercise a day and poorer children are most likely to miss out

many experts think physical activity needs to start at a very young age and one place taking up the mantle is teddy bears nursery in washford west somerset

teacher alison welch leads a physical activity programme there designed to boost childrens physical skills and teach them that exercise can be fun

one game involves children using cardboard tubes to push plastic balls around the hall aiming for a series of coloured hoops laid on the floor

it is all part of healthy movers a governmentfunded programme for two to fouryearolds

it is run by charity youth sport trust in 15 nurseries and early years centres in west somerset the area ranked bottom in the governments social mobility index the index measures the chances that a child from a disadvantaged background will do well at school and get a good job

lack of exercise is a huge factor in poor physical health and obesity it is also linked with poor emotional wellbeing and if children reach reception age without the core physical strength to sit straight in a chair or to grip a pencil they start school at a massive disadvantage

youth sport trust says children must start early aiming to boost fitness strength agility and skills before they have the chance to be selfconscious about their bodies and start trying to avoid school pe

experienced pe teacher flo holmes who coordinates the scheme blames the childhood fitness slump on the burgeoning use of screens from babyhood while fewer children play outside these days

she quotes research showing a midprimary school tipping point where girls in particular decide whether or not they enjoy being physically active

we just need to be making sure that physical activity is fun and enjoyable she says before adding it is also about physical literacy

we mean improving their physical skills but also their motivation their confidence and so their enjoyment

in the hall the childrens focus is paying off like mini hockey players they weave the plastic balls around each other aiming for the correct coloured hoops with remarkable success

flo is impressed ive taken year 7 girls and they wouldnt be able to do that she says

so far only a few hundred children have taken part in the programme since it began in october 2018 but the interim results are encouraging

the children are more active than expected more physically confident and display better physical skills object control and locomotion say their teachers

some of the movements we might be doing are not just gross motor skills theyre fine motor skills as well flo explains

we might be wiggling and weaving a ribbon or scarf and the children think theyre just having a lovely time but actually what were really doing is looking at their finger and thumb formation and were using the left and the right hand so were just trying to make control of a pencil that much easier for them

alison says she absolutely wholeheartedly loves the scheme

she says last years nursery children who were the first to do the programme were far more schoolready than previous year groups

i think it really has made a difference to their ability to sit and concentrate and their listening skills as well

she is hoping for a similar boost for this years group

alison says the children are so enthused by the activities they repeat them in the playground and at home improvising with whatever objects they have available this helps their creativity and resourcefulness in the classroom

each child gets a backpack including a ball a beanbag and activity cards to help parents continue the good work

in the classroom eliza four proudly shows off her name which she has written at the top of her latest painting

her mum lucy says she has detected a vast improvement in elizas coordination

she made her own games up and were playing them at home so she would always find something like a bowl and would be chucking her beanbag into the bowl trying to aim says lucy

i think it inspires them doesnt it and to think outside the box

alithea is just three and was premature so has always struggled with her coordination according to her mum katie

its really nice to see a massive improvement i just want her to be the best she can be at anything she wants to do says katie

elsewhere the children have pushed a row of chairs into a line

is it a train asks nursery nurse kirsty

no its a helicopter and were going to costa rica to feed the animals comes the reply

the pilot decides she wants to land to load food for the animals and the children climb off their seats to collect it in the shape of wooden bricks and other toys before setting off again on their exciting journey ; since 1995 rick has been writing for the motley fool where hes a consumer and tech stocks specialist yes thats a long time with more than 20000 bylines over those 24 years hes been an analyst for motley fool rule breakers and a portfolio lead analyst for motley fool supernova since each newsletter services inception he earned his bba and mba from the university of miami and he splits his time living in miami florida and celebration florida follow market

peloton nasdaqpton is having a good run in an otherwise brutal trading week the market has rattled off its worst twoday slide since 2015 but shares of the highend fitness specialist managed to close higher on monday and tuesday

the stocks success this week is largely due to the same event thats been sending most of your portfolios investments lower this week with coronavirus fears mounting investors are connecting the dots for companies that can thrive in an environment where homebodies are the new normal peloton provides a differentiated experience that duplicates a gym workout or spinning class without having to leave the home or office

the peloton story remains largely unappreciated on wall street even after backtoback days of gains in a market deluge the stock is still trading below septembers ipo price of 29 its surprising to see peloton stock as a disappointment especially when it shares some surprising similarities to marketdarling apple nasdaqaapl yes i did say apple

when you think about what sets apple apart from rival makers of smartphones tablets computers and other gadgetry it boils down to a combination of pricing power a welloiled ecosystem and the recent push into highmargin services the iphone will set you back more than a comparably equipped smartphone pieced together by anyone else but you know its the price of admission into the proven and popular ios ecosystem lets approach peloton from that angle

peloton stationary bikes and treadmills start at 2245 and 4295 respectively obviously it doesnt cost peloton that much to actually make these cardio machines no company would stay in business for long if they had to sell stuff for less than it cost them to make it but markups matter

most of the makers of workout gear compete on price and that keeps profit margins lean peloton on the other hand has more pricing flexibility as a result of its aspirational brand and expanding ecosystem

pelotons gross margin for its connected fitness products clocked in at a healthy 405 in its latest quarter put another way for every 1000 in hardware revenue that it generated during the quarter it still retained 405 after accounting for the components and manufacturing costs

the bad news here is that peloton isnt currently profitable despite the big head start it has over the competition in terms of pricing power its spending a lot more than whats left over as gross profit to cover its corporate overhead and ambitious marketing strategies however this leads us to the importance of pelotons ecosystem owners pay 39 a month for access to its weekly live classes as well as thousands of prerecorded sessions available on demand

retention rates are high in an otherwise fickle world of fitness regimens peloton loses just 074 of its subscribers in a typical month when you make a fourfigure investment in hardware youre going to want to stick around peloton also offers a cheaper subscription membership for folks who dont want to experience a growing catalog of visual workouts without the systemconnected gadgetry

investors lately have gravitated to apple as an investment  even as hardware revenue declined in fiscal 2019  as a services play and the same can be said about peloton buy an iphone or an ipad and youre going to be an app store customer or pay up for icloud storage pelotons the same way with its digital subscriptions and the gross margins are naturally higher on that end

a subscriber base that has nearly doubled over the past year pushed pelotons gross margin up to 423 in its latest quarter it sees gross margin clocking in between 435 and 445 for the entire fiscal year for comparisons sake apples gross margin has been just below 40 in each of the past four fiscal years

peloton is a great story and its unfortunate that the spread of the novel coronavirus is whats finally drawing attention to the investment this week the company has so much in common with what sets apple apart in consumer electronics  lets see if the bullishness actually sticks around this time

ipo investing isnt for the timid but if you can appreciate a fastgrowing brand thats killing it on the services front  like apple  you may want to take peloton out for a spin ; gail bell asks experts and people in the public eye what keeps them going this week carryduff man daniel guinness down gaa ace and key player for queens university belfast in the recent sigerson cup

i usually get up at around 745am check my phone and then grab breakfast ill catch up on the nba national basketball association and any sport from the night before while im having breakfast and then i head into uni  at around 9am most weekdays

2 what might you eat in a typical working day for

breakfast when it comes to food i like to keep it plain and simple for breakfast ill go for porridge and eggs

lunch i try to make my lunch before heading to uni so ill usually have a chicken sandwich and a protein bar

dinner again with dinner i keep it clean with meat and carbs so itll either be chicken or beef with some sort of pasta rice or noodles nothing too fancy

3 is nutrition important to you

yes nutrition is really important as i train and play so often for both down and queens university for the uni team weve been training and playing matches for the electric ireland sigerson cup so i need to make sure im fuelled for training or a match that night nutrition is also key to recovering from training or a match the day before

4 best meal ever

its hard to beat stix and stones in upper queen street as i love steak or a french village breakfast i go to queens so french village is a regular stopoff point before a lecture

5 do you have a guilty pleasure

yes it has to be dominos or boojum if im looking to really treat myself

6 have you ever been on a diet if so how did it go

no i havent been on a diet im lucky in that i train and play most evenings so i dont feel its necessary to be on a strict diet being so active lets you have some freedom in what you eat i dont stress myself too much about counting calories or anything like that

7 do you take health supplements

i wouldnt say its a health supplement but i do have protein in my porridge in the morning and a protein shake after the gym or after ive been training

8 how do you relax

just the usual really  i like to get home and watch television especially sports play some ps4 or go out with my friends

9 teetotal or tipple

after a win its hard to say no to a pint with the lads so i would have to say tipple

10 stairs or lift

im normally running late so id have to say stairs i never leave myself enough time to wait for a lift i suppose it helps me get my steps in for the day as well

11 do you have a daily exercise regime

i dont really have a strict regime as my training schedules vary weekly depending on matches etc but usually i try to get some sort of training or gym session in every night after uni i cant say im a fan of morning sessions i much prefer to get a liein and then head to the gym in evening

12 best tip for everyday fitness

just try and do something every day even if its going for a walk or fitting in a quick session in the gym you rarely ever regret doing a session but you do tend to have regrets if you miss one

13 on a scale of one to 10 how fit do you think you are and how fit would you like to be

probably im about an eight at the minute with training for matches but there is always room for improvement in some area  otherwise we wouldnt be training

14 have you tried or would you try alternative therapy

no and no im a big fan of tried and tested medicine so alternative therapy wouldnt be up my street

15 were school sports happy times or do you have a memory you would rather forget

i have to say that my memories of sports in school are mostly the best memories i have we tended to have more success with the soccer team than the gaelic team in school so losing the maclarnon cup in my final year which signalled the end of school gaelic was definitely a tough one for me its been great to be able to play gaelic at university level as i get the chance to play with boys i would usually be playing against at county level so the electric ireland sigerson cup means we can carry on the school memories through to uni

16 did you ever have a health epiphany which made you change your lifestyle

no not really  or maybe i should say not yet ive always played sport since i was around four or five years old but probably when i started going to the gym in fourth year of secondary school i had a big change in attitude which made a big difference to all aspects of my fitness and lifestyle in general

17 best healthlifestyle advice you were ever given and would pass on to others

champions do extra  short and simple and really applies to all aspects of both training and life its something i definitely try to keep in mind when im on the pitch

18 who inspires you or who would you try to emulate in terms of fitness  attitude to life

as ive said im a big fan of the nba so ive always looked up to the late kobe bryant and his attitude to practice and training as well as his success outside of basketball

19 what time do you normally get to bed and do you get enough sleep

i normally get to sleep at around 1130pm or midnight which isnt great its probably one of the big things i could improve on and i know i should try to get another hour or two every night when i do it definitely makes a difference  especially if i have a match the next day

20 would you say you have a healthy attitude towards your own mortality

i suppose at aged 21 you dont really think about mortality much but i think that keeping fit and healthy for as long as possible is the aim  and whatever happens happens ; the opening of a 25000 outdoor gym along the tanilba bay foreshore has provided residents living on the tilligerry peninsula the incentive to boost their health and fitness levels funding for the project was provided through the nsw governments community sport infrastructure grant program tilligerry community association applied for the funding while the acquisition and installation of the exercise equipment was supplied by port stephens council speaking about the progress made in peace park association president fran corner said it had taken many years of hard work to turn the reserve into the popular and familyfriendly space that it is now this park hasnt always been as beautiful as it is it used to be a really boggy park you would get to the barbecues and go no further she said the council and the community have put a lot of work and money into the park and putting in the playground i think the addition of the outdoor gym is a really good fit it would also be beneficial to parents who want to exercise while keeping a close eye on their children playing in the nearby playground paterson mp meryl swanson who was on hand for the launch said that she had been really happy to advocate for the grant that was used to establish the equipment in peace park fitness and being active outdoors are such important things ms swanson said you dont need to spend two hours in the gym every day to be fit you can come down here park for 10 minutes a few times a week and use the equipment and your fitness levels will improve exponentially this park has become a place where one day children will say they remember coming down here to play and exercise following the official launch tilligerry fitness instructor leane waters from lefit demonstrated how to use each of the four pieces of equipment which comprised chest and leg presses sit up bench and pull down the outdoor gym is just one of the associations projects it has also applied to repair the headland in peace park finish the loop path between tanilba bay and foster park plant street trees in pershing place plant koala trees around tanilba point and mallabula sports complex and build a path west of the henderson park boat ramp in lemon tree passage earlier story its fit for all in tilli13the new outdoor gym in peace park tanilba bay has been installed and is ready for the public to use pictures elliemarie watts

the opening of a 25000 outdoor gym along the tanilba bay foreshore has provided residents living on the tilligerry peninsula the incentive to boost their health and fitness levels

funding for the project was provided through the nsw governments community sport infrastructure grant program

tilligerry community association applied for the funding while the acquisition and installation of the exercise equipment was supplied by port stephens council

speaking about the progress made in peace park association president fran corner said it had taken many years of hard work to turn the reserve into the popular and familyfriendly space that it is now

this park hasnt always been as beautiful as it is it used to be a really boggy park you would get to the barbecues and go no further she said

the council and the community have put a lot of work and money into the park and putting in the playground i think the addition of the outdoor gym is a really good fit

it would also be beneficial to parents who want to exercise while keeping a close eye on their children playing in the nearby playground

paterson mp meryl swanson who was on hand for the launch said that she had been really happy to advocate for the grant that was used to establish the equipment in peace park

fitness and being active outdoors are such important things ms swanson said

you dont need to spend two hours in the gym every day to be fit you can come down here park for 10 minutes a few times a week and use the equipment and your fitness levels will improve exponentially

this park has become a place where one day children will say they remember coming down here to play and exercise

following the official launch tilligerry fitness instructor leane waters from lefit demonstrated how to use each of the four pieces of equipment which comprised chest and leg presses sit up bench and pull down

the outdoor gym is just one of the associations projects it has also applied to repair the headland in peace park finish the loop path between tanilba bay and foster park plant street trees in pershing place plant koala trees around tanilba point and mallabula sports complex and build a path west of the henderson park boat ramp in lemon tree passage

earlier story its fit for all in tilli ; the romsey future and test valley borough council project will be celebrating the final instalment of the outdoor gym equipment by hosting a 10k fitness trail

funding of 35000 was secured to add a further three gym stations to the existing two making a 10k route

funding was granted from sport england community asset fund and various tvbc grants to fund additional gym stations

new gym stations are at romsey sports centre abbotswood and whitenap open space  the original two are located at mercier way and romsey war memorial park

all five stations are linked in a circular circuit making a fitness trail to be used throughout the year

the equipment at the stations is suitable for selection of cardio and strength exercises which can be used independently at any time as well as part of this 10k route on saturday february 15

romsey future leader councillor nick adamsking said i think romsey future and test valley borough council have delivered yet another aspiration identified by the first consultation five years ago

it took a little while to get together but i am pleased to be able to make another aspiration of ours happen

a spokesperson for test valley borough council said the need for additional equipment and better use of open spaces was identified through consultation on the romsey future 20 year vision for the town at numerous community events across the town in 2015

the project was launched as a result of this

residents are keen to make better use of green spaces and conscious about the need for a healthier and active lifestyle

gym stations were identified as a positive step towards this

there will be signage at every station with the attached map route and qr code enabling those taking part in the fitness trail to download the route to their phones

romsey town centre manager mark edgerley said i believe the fitness trail brings many benefits to our community including an opportunity for people to take exercise outdoors using a free facility

evidence suggests we can all improve our wellbeing and fitness by being outdoors and taking exercise the fitness trail enables people to use individual elements or to combine sections to match their individual needs

the trail also offers the opportunity to join with family and friends to participate together having fun being together is such an important aspect of modern live ; earlier this month budget smart home company wyze published a roadmap revealing the products it plans to release this year as well as how far along it is toward the launch of each product among the offerings is wyze band an activitytracking wearable that will also provide users with access to their smart home devices the ones sold by wyze that is now a new leak offers the first look at this device

read wyze details future products band scale outdoor and doorbell cameras

the wyze band is as its name suggests a simple wrist wearable with a relatively large display builtin microphone for using amazon alexa and touch controls for manually navigating on the device the leaked image and video come from dave zatz of zatz not funny where he cites the wyze beta app as the source of the information

on february 17 wyze revealed that it had entered beta testing for its wzye band which is the last step before it starts preparing for the products early access release only the wyze scale another wellness product is farther along in the development process at this time in its post the company said that in addition to offering access to alexa and smart home devices the band also tracks heart rate sleep and steps

the activity tracking aspect of the wearable is pretty basic the big benefit here is clearly the direct access to alexa and ones smart bulbs security cameras and smart plugs zatz not funny notes that wyze band also features a jogging app alarms and weather

users will be able to customize the clock face to a degree  it seems there are several different interfaces available to choose from some with dark atmospheric backgrounds and others with simple time and step count figures on a bright white background theres still no word on when the wyze band will launch in early access and how much it will cost ; the man found guilty of killing an abbotsford police officer in a 2017 shootout will not face a hearing to determine his mental fitness at the time of the murder a bc supreme court judge ruled thursday

the decision by justice carol ross means the firstdegree murder verdict for oscar arfmann will stand after all  along with an automatic life sentence with no chance of parole for 25 years

arfmann was found guilty of killing const john davidson in october 2019 but the conviction was not entered into the record after madame justice carol ross ordered a second psychiatric assessment of arfmann to determine his mental state at the time of the shooting

that assessment resulted in a report that found the possibility arfmann was in a mental state in which he didnt realize what he was doing was wrong and was suffering from psychotic symptoms of schizophrenia

but at a jan 13 hearing to discuss the report arfmanns lawyer said his client did not wish to pursue a defence that he was not criminally responsible ncr for the killing

that left it up to ross herself to determine whether it was up to the court to allow the hearing which had already been scheduled for february to proceed

in the end the judge ruled that despite the court having jurisdiction to order the ncr hearing regardless of crown and defences opinions she would not exercise that right in this case

in her decision ross noted the court did not hear a proven absence of motive from any of the several witnesses at trial none of whom could testify to arfmanns mental capacity

the only evidence which could cast further light onto this issue is mr arfmann but he is not a compellable witness and has refused to testify ross noted

while arfmann has refused to acknowledge or discuss the events of nov 6 2017 that led to davidsons murder his psychiatric assessments have determined he was capable of appreciating the nature and quality of his actions at the time the decision reads

ross quotes arfmanns most recent assessment that says because he wont discuss his crimes it limits the ability to precisely link his psychotic symptoms with the offence

arfmanns lawyer also told the court at the jan 13 hearing that his client was fit to make the instruction not to continue with a ncr defence

arfmanns conviction will now conclude with a sentencing hearing set for feb 3 where victim impact statements will be read and arfmanns parole eligibility will be officially determined

davidson was responding along with other abbotsford police officers to reports of a stolen vehicle being driven by arfmann when he was shot in what crown described as an ambush

arfmann was arrested near the shooting scene after a standoff with several officers

dashcam video played at the trial last summer and released publicly this month shows arfmann pointing a gun at a pickup truck in a parking lot at the time of the shooting

davidson was a 24year veteran of the police force and his death drew condolences from across the country and his home in the uk ; there have been great smartwatches looking at you apple and great fitness watches for people whose idea of a good time is running for three days only stopping for naps but the 799 suunto 7 is the first watch ive seen that does both well

the first thing you notice once youve set up the suunto 7 is the heatmap in the background of the default watch face it shows you the locations where all the people who prefer your particular style of exercise do their thing even for someone who doesnt run anywhere near as much as i used to seeing the hot trails in melbourne where people are probably running right now makes me tempted to lace up my shoes and go join them which is the point

in the suunto app you can see even more of these trails openwater swimming seems really popular in st kilda and zooming out to see more of victoria i can see the first half of my mums usual running track is popular but few are foolhardy enough to do the other half of her weekly trek

while seeing everyones data trails sounds unnerving it doesnt identify who any of these people are or show individual routes only which pathsroadspools are popular thats not only useful locally but it also allows you to locate the safe and populated routes when youre travelling you can instantly see where the most people hike or swim rather than just going online and digging to see where people say they go ; tony holbrook is the founder  ceo of bestbox fitness  president of untappeddigital learn more at httpstonyholbrookca

part of the battle of being an entrepreneur in todays digital landscape is learning to use social media to evangelize for your brand effectively whether youre a personal trainer or the owner of a multilocation gym in the fitness industry your target customers are the end consumer you need to carefully consider how and where you speak to them

after a decade of working in corporate marketing im diving into the fitness sector ive learned so much in my talks with gym owners and coaches about their unique social media needs and ive formed some thoughts on how to approach social media content and management for fitness entrepreneurs

instagram and facebook

these two channels are the most commonly used in the fitness sector and they work together fluidly to be effective on these platforms though you need to be operating in the business space

its easiest to break into instagram by establishing a personal profile but to gain access to some of the advanced insights reporting and promotional tools you should establish a business account and to do that you have to have a facebook business page

both channels have a very mature interface for business management so if your longterm goals include leveraging these platforms for business marketing youre going to need the help of those tools that are only available for business pages

when you set up a personal instagram account it can become difficult to control access and delegate management to your team as the account owner youll serve as a sort of superadmin making it harder for the social media manager to do their job when ownership and management are fractured like this its harder to claim handles and bring them all into a centralized ad platform

as far as content goes the approach is simple generally crosspost everything from instagram to facebook find things to easily document eg photos of a training session a candid interview with staff video content from actual workouts and dont worry too much about production value just get the content out there and let people start talking about it

consider instagram your gateway its the visual channel while facebook is where you nurture your community thats where you can link to your website blog or partner assets find harmony between the channels by using images on instagram to ignite conversations on facebook

tiktok

one of my favorite bits of advice from serial entrepreneur gary vaynerchuk is document dont create dont overthink your content just document what youre doing put some thought behind it and if youre genuine it will translate

tiktok could be very powerful for brands if they move past the assumption that its for teenagers its a very simple content creation platform and the music element is especially intriguing the song underpinning each video works like a hashtag and you can ride the trend of a popular song to get noticed by a very large number of people

its a great way to make things fun in an industry thats easy to document tiktok natively has a lot of capabilities for sharing quickly to other platforms as well like instagram and facebook so it can be a good way to get a quick win

youtube

if youre doing things like podcasts instructional videos or tutorials youtube can serve as a great repository for those assets wellproduced videos get high search traffic and rankings even years later

quality stands out because of this production cost is typically higher than your other social content but if you want to become known as someone who is a leader in the techniquemovement space this is how to do it

if youre doing podcasting or vlogging this is also a great place to put raw captured footage you can use video interviews here to anchor your content while you split the audio asset to live on other channels such as spotify itunes apple podcast or even patreon

linkedin

linkedin has a different kind of clientele but its an interesting and untapped space for fitness entrepreneurs the people engaging on this channel are typically business professionals whose mentality and lifestyles lead to them being more on top of their fitness

as with all social media linkedin is a community and people want you to provide value and contribute more than you take if youre selling a program and thats all you ever talk about youll be dismissed as a sleazy salesperson

however if youre providing value eg movement tips discussions of form and technique evaluations of nutritional approaches people are going to engage with you linkedins video platform is constantly improving and its a great place to share that content

before you do that though clean up your personal profile have a professional headshot ask for references from people youve trained and connect with others in the industry so they can share your content then launch your business page

even if your company is just you you still want a business page as the functionality works differently you can add employees down the road and create subpages to showcase products another plus is that business linkedin has great integration with the last channel i want to cover

twitter

twitter is honestly not a great marketing avenue its not effective for promoting your business because there are approximately 6000 tweets sent every second the volume is astronomical things get swept to the bottom very fast

that said twitter is a great place to engage in dialogue if you have a strong opinion about something in the fitness industry such as certain types of diets supplements training regimens etc twitter is the place to have spirited debates around those things

but its not for everyone unless youre digitally savvy and twitter is already a part of your day i wouldnt spend too much time here

social media is constantly changing but as we launch further into 2020 these channels are a great place for fitness entrepreneurs to start building and evangelizing for their brands ; this 11minute series was designed by dr bill orban in the 50s to keep pilots in shape

zion born as a boy came home and said hey so i want to talk to you guys i think going forward i am ready to live my truth said the 13time allstar i want to be referenced as she and her i would love for you guys to call me zaya

wade added when our child comes home with a question when our child comes home with an issue when our child comes home with anything its our job as parents to listen to that to give them the best information that we can the best feedback that we can  and that doesnt change because sexuality is now involved in it

parenting union took to twitter with a clip of dwyane and zaya chatting about life while riding in a golf cart

wade who played for the miami heat for the majority of his career said that he and wife gabrielle union are proud parents of a child in the lgbtq community and  proud allies as well who take their roles and responsibility as parents very seriously

wade said he and union were focused on trying to figure out as much information as we can to make sure that we give our child the best opportunity to be her best self

union last week took to twitter with a clip of dwyane and zaya chatting about life while riding in a golf cart

she captioned the shot meet zaya shes compassionate loving whip smart and we are so proud of her its ok to listen to love  respect your children exactly as they are love and light good people

whats the point of being on this earth if youre gonna try to be someone youre not she said its like youre not even living as yourself which is like the dumbest concept to me be true and dont really care what the stereotypical way of being you is

she added that she remains patient and perseverance amid the times of change

you gotta just push through i mean its worth it i feel like its very worth it when you reach that point of like yourself ; before and after lianne seddon opened a new ww wellness workshop after her own wellness journey helped her achieve a positive mindset and lose 36 and a half pounds

a fulltime working mum from runcorn who lost almost three stone has opened her own fitness workshop in a bid to help others

lianne seddon opened a new ww wellness workshop after her own wellness journey helped her achieve a positive mindset and lose 36 and a half pounds

her wellness journey in june 2017 she said i hated seeing myself in photos and knew that i didnt want another holiday where i was avoiding photos from the neck down

i joined the week after we got back from spain in june 2017 but although i lost a stone by the september i then hovered for a good few months up and down with the same few pounds

it wasnt until april time last year i decided enough was enough and our florida holiday was looming in november

when we went to florida i had lost 35lbs and achieved my ultimate goal of not hiding from the camera

lianne loved the programme that much she wanted to become a coach to help others reach their wellness goals

now lianne is bringing the leading programme to help those in the runcorn  widnes area

lianne said now i am more aware of what im eating and i absolutely make smarter choices i also know that having one bad meal or day wont affect my overall end goal

ive also started to exercise more as it really helps me lose inches and its not just about that number on the scales with ww

when asked what lianne likes about being a coach she said i love that i can relate to other people and inspire them to make the changes in their life that they want whether this be to lose weight get healthy or exercise

because i am on the plan i am living proof it works and i am literally living the plan weekly with my members i still go and get weighed and know how they feel

ww wellness coaches go through five weeks of extensive training that includes face to face workshops with guidance from ww wellness coach ; five months later in december 2019 i gave myself an even bigger shock when i weighed myself and discovered i was 137 lbs  exactly 23 lbs lighter than i was at the start of the year closer to a normal weight for my height and the lightest i had ever been in my entire adult life

it felt like a small miracle i was after all a girl whose belowaverage fitness and aboveaverage laziness became part of her personality

i took pride in being the kind of girl who lounged in bed eating ferrero rochers while watching her very fit best friend work out i shared that britney spears my lower back is killing me meme on facebook and delighted in the haha reactions it got i paraded my bilbil in a bikini proudly as a big fck you to mainstream beauty standards i made jokes about total strangers mistaking me for pregnant  even once took advantage of it when a conductor offered me the best seat on a crowded rush hour bus and i held my belly throughout the ride for good measure admittedly not my proudest moment

as comfortable as i was in my fatness i was also aware that i wasnt very healthy i experienced constant back pain and knee pain my skin was sallow and dull and required an excessive amount of highlighter to look glowy i couldnt climb a flight of stairs without heaving i loved the beach but i couldnt swim very far or deep into the open sea i had always wanted to hike a mountain but never felt physically able to i can imagine my kidneys and liver could not have been too happy with all the fast food sugar and alcohol i was consuming i woke up hungover too often and the alcohol also made me not too well mentally

when i signed up for the gym that day in july i was evaluated by a trainer he took my measurements using a fancy machine that took recorded not just my overall weight but my body fat muscle mass and metabolism the results of the evaluation made all the downsides of my unhealthy lifestyle more tangible 449 body fat 192 skeletal muscle mass 256 bmi body mass index 656 kg at 53

the trainer also told me that my core was weak my spine was uneven my lower back was compensating for most of my weight therefore pain and my vital organs were surrounded by a thick layer of visceral fat  which put me at risk for more serious health problems

at this point i realized that being comfortable in my fatness didnt mean i was happy

cut to today ive gone from squeezing myself to size 14 jeans to comfortably wearing a size 8 to 10 ive gone from looking 5 months pregnant to maybe only 2 months pregnant now hehe ive gone from someone who felt like a boxing session every 3 weeks was enough exercise to someone who works out at least 3 times a week ive gone from being a regular user of the mcdelivery app to starting each day with a fruitandveg smoothie ive gone from not being able to climb a flight of stairs without heaving to being able to climb a mountain disclaimer a relatively easy mountain but i did it

more importantly i feel stronger more capable more motivated to try new things and more in control of not just my body but my mind

like i said when i look at my progress everything feels like a bit of a miracle  except its not as many weight loss and fitness experts have said before me in much more eloquent terms getting healthy is just a matter of putting in the work being patient getting used to being uncomfortable and sometimes tricking myself into making healthier choices

getting healthy isnt easy especially if you have a timeconsuming career a family to care for or other underlying health problems but it isnt impossible and if youre committed eventually itll just become part of your new lifestyle im no professional and im obviously not 100 healthy i have a cookie habit i cant seem to break but here are a few things ive kept in mind that have helped me get to a point where i can look in the mirror and legitimately proudly say who is she

you cant change your lifestyle all at once  itll happen gradually

i may count july as the month that i really got into the full swing of getting healthy  but i made changes to my lifestyle long before that in april 2019 i went cold turkey on alcohol  and i let that drastic change sink in before doing anything else around june i started intermittent fasting and introducing myself to healthy food  and i waited til i got used to that before i decided to take exercise more seriously

changing your habits bit by bit just makes your health kick more sustainable  and makes the progress even more surprising and satisfying

prioritize how you feel over how you look

throughout this whole getting healthy thing i decided to focus on feeling great as opposed to just looking good physical changes take a while to manifest but that feelgood rush after working out is almost instantaneous its been months since i started working out regularly and while ive seen significant physical changes i still have a pudgy belly and cellulite on my thighs

if i focused on getting rock solid abs and a butt that could launch a thousand instagram likes id probably be more frustrated that ive put in so much work and my body doesnt look like that yet but my bilbil doesnt bother me much because every time i work out my muscles feel stronger my mind feels clearer my anxiety feels less overwhelming disclosure im also on daily medication and i sleep better this is way more satisfying  and much faster to achieve than the idea of looking like jlo in hustlers

go cold turkey on one big unhealthy thing

it could be sugar fast food cigarettes in my case it was alcohol i used to have a terrible drinking habit so when i went teetotal it had a ripple effect on my health being sober helped me sleep better so i had more energy to go to the gym no longer waking up hungover kept me away from all the greasy hangover food also no alcohol allowed me to keep my mental health in check which puts me in a better state of mind to make healthy choices

aside from giving me a big leg up on being healthy quitting alcohol became a sort of beacon whenever i strayed off the path a bit if i indulged in too many cookies or went a while without working out my sobriety gave me incentive to get back on track  if only because i dont want to waste the effort of saying no to all the cocktails i wish i could drink also remembering that ive done a very difficult thing  that is completely cutting out something i truly enjoyed for my health  made getting to the gym on a lazy day seem like a cakewalk

attach a healthy habit to an existing habit

when i started going to the gym i wanted to be the type of person who started each day with exercise as someone who sleeps late and therefore wakes up late this seemed impossible to do  until i made it a rule for myself to only shower after ive worked out a daily shower was necessary to me so going to the gym became necessary too also it helped a lot that my gyms showers have hot water  a luxury that my condo doesnt have

i know other people that have attached gym time to their tv viewing habits  they only watch an episode of a show they follow when theyre on the treadmill for instance others have turned their daily commutes into an opportunity for exercise by biking to work whatever it is find something you do everyday and latch your workout to that

celebrate everything

working out for 30 minutes or choosing a salad over chicken nuggets may not seem like a big deal but if its not something you used to do its worth celebrating im not saying you should buy yourself a reward for every little thing you do who has the money but pat yourself on the back and mentally congratulate yourself every time you do something good for your body

brewed your own coffee instead of drinking a sugarladen 3in1 yay lost half a pound yaaaaay climbed a flight of stairs without feeling like youre on the brink of death yaaaaaaaaay did an extra rep with a heavier weight yaaaaaaaaaay theres nothing like the sound of a million internal yaaaaays to drown out that voice thats calling you back to an unhealthy comfort zone

also it goes without saying that if you hit bigger milestones like achieving a fat loss goal or being able to do a difficult yoga pose or lifting a certain weight you deserve more than a yay  perhaps a spa day a new set of workout clothes or a weekend getaway

share your journey with someone

getting healthy is a personal thing and i can understand why anyone would wanna keep it private  and just shock the world months later by emerging as a brand new person but changing your lifestyle is extremely difficult and having people to cheer you on and hold you to your goals helps immensely and is almost necessary sharing your health binge could be a matter of joining a facebook group posting updates on instagram or partnering up with someone who also wants to get fit and healthy which is what i did

whenever im not in the mood to work out and this happens more often than id care to admit i whine to my chosen person who then reminds me that if i go to the gym anyway ill feel better afterwards  and hes always right whenever i make progress i share it with him and the excitement doubles along with my motivation when he makes progress its the same thing

set upper and lower limits

when it came to exercise i gave myself a bare minimum number of reps and sets per exercise 10 reps 3 sets and a minimum number of workouts a week 3 days a week 2 when im pmsing when it comes to eating healthy i set a maximum one cookie or unhealthy thing a day but only if i must these limits help when youre really not in the mood to do this health thing no matter how minimal your bare minimums are they are something  and thats always better than nothing at the same time setting a maximum will keep your cravings in check and still give you control over what you eat

think longterm

when your old unhealthy habits get the better of you on certain days its okay i used to be overwhelmed with guilt every time i went on a noexercise or bingeeating streak and it would make me want to throw in the towel and just go back to being a couch potato

ive since learned to remind myself that i intend be healthy for the rest of my life  so being unhealthy for a few days really doesnt matter in the grand scheme of things as long as your upper and lower limits are in place you really shouldnt feel guilty about lightly stepping back into your comfort zone every now and then  rapplercom ; coronation street star katie mcglynn looked sensational in an animal print twopiece on holiday in mexico earlier this year taking a welldeserved break from her rigorous new workout regime

with new exercises invented every week new gurus trending by the day and a fresh study that contradicts all the other ones released every time you think youre getting the hang of things its easy to think that fitness is confusing  but it isnt

the fundamentals stay the same and the science is pretty well agreed  so by simply arming yourself with a few basic facts you can step into any gym forewarned against whatever fresh nonsense the fitstagrammers are preaching these are the 10 biggest myths in fitness  exercise your synapses for a couple of minutes by memorising them and do your curls with confidence

soreness is a sign of a good workout

yes theres something masochistically satisfying about limping your way down a flight of stairs the morning after a big legs workout but delayed onset muscle soreness  doms to its instabuddies  isnt actually a convincing indicator of progress its thought to be caused by microtears in muscle and tends to crop up when you do movements youre not used to when you deliberately slow down the eccentric or musclelengthening part of whatever move youre doing such as the downward bit of a squat or just do a ridiculous number of reps conversely then you can eliminate soreness almost entirely by keeping the reps low or doing moves that dont have an eccentric such as throws and sled pushes there is such a thing as painfree progress

lifting heavy will make you bulky

there are two key ways to get stronger increasing the size of your individual muscle fibres and recruiting more of them to fire together when you need to use them the first is what bodybuilders aim to do but the second is what your body would do  automatically  if you had to lift a car off a loved one in sports where excess size is a negative it is what competitors teach themselves to do this is how female olympic weightlifters in the lighter weight categories can outlift larger men getting big requires specific targeted training including lots of volume and extra calories and protein  and it almost never happens by accident

scales are pointless

this ones been popularised by modern fitness gurus who will fairly sensibly point out that weight isnt a true measure of progress as fluctuations in the amount of water being retained can lead to daytoday shifts in the numbers and putting on muscle can lead to the numbers going up while youre making progress in the right direction this doesnt mean you should toss away your scales entirely yes you have to understand that shortterm fluctuations are inevitable and dont represent changes in body fat says emma storeygordon the trainerowner of esg fitness but over time changes in scale weight are predictive of body fat even if you are also building muscle the rate at which you can lose fat will be much quicker than the rate at which you can build muscle dont become overreliant on them but scales can show whether youre moving in the right direction

exercise is bad for your knees

actually its more like the opposite properly done squats will strengthen the stabiliser muscles around your knee joints safeguarding you against injury as well as making you a bit more capable of bounding up escalators as for running a 20year study conducted by stanford university found that consistent runners many of whom were well into their 70s by the time the research period ended showed a lower incidence of arthritis than nonrunners as they aged it also showed that runners have a lower risk of osteoarthritis and hip replacements suggesting that pounding pavements isnt actually as bad for you as advertised

you can spot reduce fat

while we all lived in the offline wilderness the myth persisted that you could for instance target the fat around your midriff by doing hundreds of situps that myth has been mostly wiped by the ubiquity of the internet but replaced by the more subtle halftruth that its possible to single out problem areas by thinking hormonally that since for instance the stress hormone cortisol causes bellyfat buildup a bit more sleep and a few sessions on the calm app should see your abs emerge and while this is technically sort of true deliberately messing with your hormones is tougher than advertised and not really advisable the truth is we all have stubborn fat areas that seem to take the longest to get lean says storeygordon there are various reasons for this  hormones and sex both play a role for instance these cant be easily changed so you cant really choose where you lose fat from dont give up though stubborn areas will get leaner alongside everything else patience is the key

less rest means youre working harder

crossfit and endless neontinted edmsoundtracked fitness classes have made rest a fourletter word in the fitness industry but constant movement for the sake of it could actually be hindering your gains not helping them for most people  especially beginners  periods of recovery between sets or intervals allows for higherintensity betterquality movement lower risk of injury and a greater training stimulus that is likely to lead to superior results says the performance and wellbeing coach george anderson or in other words if you push yourself for an hour straight youll be forced to lift lower weights go slower and generally put in less work than you might with some strategic downtime and the optimum varies  for fat loss anywhere from 15 to 60 seconds between sets is ideal but for strength you might spend five minutes preparing for ultraintense efforts

machines are pointless or dangerous

as sparseandspartan gym spaces emphasising basic barbell movements have proliferated so too has the idea that using machines to train is at best inefficient at worst dangerous machines force your body into awkward overlinear movement patterns goes the theory  reducing the input from important stabiliser muscles and stopping you from moving naturally but while there is some truth to this not every machine is the enemy whether youre a timepoor techniquefree novice or a more advanced lifter machines can involve less setup allow more work and provide extra stimulus to isolated muscle groups says the trainer dan osman that said the leg press is no substitute for learning to squat properly

the crosstrainer is the best fullbody cardio machine

lets be honest youve never seen britains greatest living olympian sir steve redgrave dryheaving over the side of a crosstrainer it may be intuitive and burn some calories but thats all this outdated relic offers says dr cameron nichol the founder of rowingwod when done correctly the rowing machine uses 86 of your muscles spanning nine major muscle groups the rower also works with the time you have  if you need a short horrible finisher a 500metre sprint will leave you sucking air and burning fat while a more ponderous 10k feels almost meditative and the olympiclength 2k is a test of will as much as power

shorter is better

once the fourminute tabata  20 seconds of work and 10 seconds of rest repeated eight times  seemed the logical endpoint of the workoutshortening craze with claims that it could replace much longer training sessions while offering roughly the same benefits now it seems almost glacial with three two and oneminute workouts promising to harness highintensity interval trainings hiit mystical powers and leave you more time for candy crush the truth anything is better than nothing and its certainly possible to make some gains in whatever limited time you have but longer workouts have effects that no microworkout can mimic oh and by the way in the original tabata study the test subjects  who were professional cyclists  worked so intensely that some of them refused to countenance trying the protocol again if youre not doing that theres no guarantee it will work as advertised

there is one best way to train

is running better than lifting for longevity do you need the mobility yoga offers more than a really jacked set of quads is zumba just a waste of valuable time that you could spend boxercising whatever training style you experiment with youll find someone ready to argue that everything else is useless and stupid that you should stick with them or go home says dr michael banna this kind of absolutism risks deflating people by telling them that their efforts have been pointless the reality is any physical activity has health benefits the right type is the one that doesnt injure you make you sad or make you want to stop ideally your physical activity should include a mixture of cardio resistance and mobility work spread across the week  but do what you enjoy

 joel snape is a former editor of mens fitness and runs the website livehard ; trainer yasmin karachiwala reveals the fitness secrets of deepika padukone katrina kaif and alia bhatt and why the trend of body makeover for a film shouldnt be promoted

we all know how deepika padukone makes all heads turn when she descends the red carpet and how stunning katrina kaif looks even in a night suit but what lies behind their great figures is the hard work they put in to get that desirable body in a candid chat with hindustan times fitness trainer yasmin karachiwala spilled the secrets behind their washboard abs toned figures of celebrities their fitness mantra and the trend of makeovers in bollywood

excerpts

you just shared a workout video of deepika padukone slogging in the gym what is the secret behind her great body

the secret is her commitment to fitness and her dedication she knows that working out makes her feel really good whether its 7 in the morning or sometimes even 6 or 5 am she makes sure that she gets a good workout before she heads for a shoot

you also train katrina kaif alia bhatt and many others who is the most hard working and dedicated among the lot

anybody who works out with me has to be hard working and dedicated otherwise i dont train them all of them are hardworking i dont think people who pay that kind of money can afford to be lazy its their hardearned money you only put your money in training when you want to see results

katrina is very hardworking and fitness is really important for her no matter how packed her day is she finds that one hour for workout even if she has to do it between meetings or shoots she takes out that one hour and focuses on fitness to a great extent

alia does a lot of pilates with me but since the last six months she has been very busy with all the different movies that shes been shooting for she used to be very regular but now we do pilates whenever she gets time

who do you think is the fittest man and woman in bollywood

akshay kumar is definitely the fittest man in bollywood talking about women all of them are great

actors lose and gain weight too frequently isnt it harmful for a human body to do it so often

for a normal person its very harmful an actor is paid a lot of money to fit into the role that they want its the choice they make if anyone needs to gain 20 kgs for a role its the choice they are making and weighing it with the amount they are getting paid for the movie they weigh it with who the director is or what the script is its something very job related i am not in a situation to comment on why they are doing it what your job requires is what you do

does it affect a human body in the long run

of course it does but if an actor is to gain 20 kgs for a movie the moment it is over they come back to being fit and start eating right they take care of themselves unlike in the past when people werent much aware the actors these days are very knowledgeable and well read about how to take care of their bodies and are constantly doing it

what do you suggest to people who want to look like their favourite celebrities

i believe each persons body is unique to themselves and each body type is very different from the other what i always tell my clients is look at the body you have and try to make it the best that you can get look at others for motivation but its not like a person who is 52 can look like deepika padukone her body is longer her muscles are longer her limbs are longer you can look better in your own body each of us needs to accept our body and work on making that the best

also see aishwarya rai shares gorgeous new pic from dabboo ratnanis calendar says 21 years being family with your calendar

what advice would you give to those who are too busy to work out

even if you are working for 9 hours a day you still have 15 hours a day to do something with your fitness you are never too busy to find time for your fitness if you are fit you are healthy will live longer and will have a better quality of life its your choice  whether you want a fitter longer life one must find at least 20 minutes a day to do something about it ; pep guardiola says raheem sterling could return for manchester city at real madrid in the champions league

manchester city fans think raheem sterling should not start at real madrid on wednesday even if he is back to full fitness

sterling has missed citys last two games with a hamstring injury after limping out of the tottenham defeat before the winter break

the winger had been considered a major doubt for the real madrid game but has been pictured in training during the last week

hes much much much better i think hell be ready the city boss said at the king power stadium after seeing his side battle to a 10 win

before sterlings injury he had gone eight games without scoring or assisting for city representing somewhat of a drought in front of goal given the high standards he set himself at the start of the season

that might explain why city fans want guardiola to exercise caution at the bernabeu by not rushing sterling back too soon

when men sport asked fans whether sterling should start or come off the bench 617 per cent wanted to see him eased back into action as a substitute if needed

only 383 per cent want sterling to start at the bernabeu

citys other fitness worries are aymeric laporte who limped off against leicester and leroy sane

however guardiola confirmed laporte will be fine to start in madrid saying he asked me to be substituted but hes not injured hes been four months five months injured we cant forget that he had to run a lot it was different against west ham we could control it easier hes ok

sane has not played since resuming full training after his longterm injury with guardiola insisting he would take his time before reintroducing the german to match action ; an interactive game that has already helped more than one million people get active across the uk is coming to chesterfield this month

the video currently has more than 35000 likes since its upload on january 2 ; buy buy baby the retail store selling clothing and supplies for infants and small children has nearly cleared out of its 34000squarefoot space at 310 n randall road in batavia

in its place will be a new location for the edge fitness clubs an exercise chain that is breaking into the chicagoland market

at a committeelevel vote on tuesday the batavia city council approved a conditional use permit for edge fitness to occupy the retail space as a recreational facility

chris beson senior project manager with edge fitness said the new club is expected to open for business in about eight or nine months

the city of batavia has long regarded the randall road commercial corridor as its sales taxgenerating economic engine and sought to limit nonretail business uses there

however batavia planning and zoning officer joel strassman told alderman that the city staff supports the fitness club plan because it will increase foot traffic in the shopping center

approval would allow for fast turnover of the lease space and avoid prolonged vacancy strassman said

while retail sales tax revenue generated by this space with health club use would be less than by a retail user the proposed tenant may generate new customers for area retailers increasing their sales strassman said

the club plans to sell apparel and exercise equipment creating some sales tax revenue from the business strassman said

the retail space is located in the wind point shopping center sandwiched between the kohls store and office max other businesses in the shopping center include hobby lobby and aldi

bernard citron an attorney representing property owner kir batavia told aldermen that the closure of buy buy baby has already reduced foot traffic for the neighboring businesses

this club will bring people into the center citron said adding that exercise facilities are lacking in the area

this market is somewhat underserved citron said

beson told aldermen that the club expects to have 10000 members by its third year of operation

during the week the club will be open 24hoursaday from 4 am monday to 9 pm friday beson said the facility will be open from 7 am to 7 pm on saturday and sunday he said

the club will always have staff members present when the facility is open beson assured aldermen

edge fitness offers group exercise classes led by instructors as well as personal training

batavia aldermen are expected to give final approval for the plan at the feb 3 council meeting

edge fitness operates facilities in st louis detroit and several eastern states it is opening clubs in naperville crystal lake and orland hills ; real madrid winger eden hazard will undergo medical tests after being forced off the pitch against levante with an apparent ankle injury

real did win the supercopa de españa earlier this season but theyve already been knocked out of the copa del rey  and hazards injury will give manchester city the slight advantage in next weeks champions league last 16 match ; shrewsbury town are hoping injured trio shaun whalley brad walker and josh vela may be ready to play some part against doncaster on saturday

sam ricketts men have been struck down by a handful of damaging knocks in recent weeks but could be boosted for the important home league one clash

whalley has not featured since the fa cup replay at anfield where he limped off with a hamstring injury late on

but shrews are hopeful he could play a part in training this week and at least take a place on the bench

central midfielder walker picked up a similar muscle injury in training a fortnight ago at a time when underfire boss ricketts could illafford to lose any more midfielders but he too is nearing a return

vela 26 a january signing from scottish premiership side hibernian is yet to make his debut for shrewsbury after picking up a quad injury before christmas and town are keen to ease him in to ensure no longterm damage is caused

ricketts maintains that the former bolton stalwart is a coup and that he will prove a significant boost when available for shrews who are 10 without a win in the league

the town boss insists the week has been a crucial one for his sides recovery he has said in recent weeks that his squad are down to the bare bones

it is just the second week in 2020 that shrewsbury have been without a midweek clash

well have to see how that one goes but hopefully so we want some players back ricketts said when asked about hamstring victims whalley and walker returning to training

were also missing josh vela who weve taken in and has slightly gone under the radar but is a very very good acquisition for the club

were taking a longterm view on him to make sure hes right

the clubs and his longterm future are more important than the immediate one even though we are in a difficult period resultswise

my job is to make sure we are progressing and growing

results are extremely frustrating at the minute but we have to make sure were doing things right and josh is part of that

after the visit of doncaster they welcome back former boss micky mellon and his tranmere side on tuesday night ; the former bodybuilder is now a personal trainer at energie fitness in dumbarton and is still in great shape

they say that age is just a number and nobody is proving that more than david hall

the personal trainer at energie fitness in dumbarton turns 61 next month however he still dreams of returning to the bodybuilding stage  while inspiring people a third of his age at the high street gym

speaking to the lennox herald david who is originally from jamaica but now lives in old kilpatrick revealed that he hasnt always been in peak physical condition

he said when i was younger like 17 or so i was very very unfit and one day i decided that i should be able to run around all the time i havent looked back since

forty years on im still going strong and i think for an almost 61yearold im in pretty good nick

the military was the baseline for it i was in for 10 years and when i started i would be doing exercise every day  running mainly if i hadnt joined the military then i dont think id be here talking to you

as long as there is a breath inside me then ill just keep going

davids move into bodybuilding came after he returned from hong kong and it was something that he loved instantly

he continued one day one of my friends encouraged me to try the weights i joined a gym in glasgow and got myself into decent shape

bodybuilding is like being a popstar you really get a buzz out of it

i did my first competition in 1990 and came fourth which was an achievement for my first time competing so the potential was there

if you try hard then you never know what you might be able to achieve

i enjoyed it so i kept competing right up until i was about 40 i think i competed about 15 or 20 times all in

my family see pictures of me and i think theyre very very proud of my achievements  they give me plenty of encouragement

ive always said that id like to compete again but ill be 61 next month

i wouldnt say its an addiction it motivates me to keep going and deep down i know ive got another competition in me

david is keen to pass on his experience to much younger clients at the gym while he has no plans to give up any time soon

he added i get a lot of respect from the younger folk who cant believe ive been in training for over 40 years

i get a lot of encouragement and i can always pass on experience to these folk even the manager and other trainers want to be like me and im two or three times their age

if i live to be 80 or 90 as long as i can still breathe and still move then ill still be training

u23s manager neil critchley is set to take charge of a youthful reds side at anfield for the second meeting with the league one team after a 22 draw at new meadow

larouci who started that game in january sustained an injury while representing the u23s last week but could still be in contention for the return tie

yasser obviously came off last week we have todays training session and tomorrow so well have a meeting before training today to find out the latest with yasser that was unfortunate

hopefully he makes it if he doesnt thatll provide opportunity for one or two others  were quite well blessed in that area this season other than yasser thats it ; the mayor of new plymouth says local authorities should be required to pass a warrant of fitness on the state of their water infrastructure

he estimates it will take a decade and hundreds of millions of dollars to get new plymouths infrastructure to a standard where its fit for purpose

neil holdom says many other towns and cities are in the same boat

holdom was speaking after an extraordinary meeting of the council yesterday where it approved a 43 million repair to the thermal drying component of its wastewater treatment plant

in a report to council the gasfired unit  which dries solid waste from sewage for use as fertiliser  was described as being at risk of sudden and total failure

the council shut down the unit yesterday pending repairs

the report blames the poor state of the unit on a 2015 decision to cut back on maintenance because the councils long term plan envisaged it being replaced

holdom said the thermal dryer was just the tip of the iceberg

i think that there are parts of our water wastewater and stormwater networks that will be in the same or poorer condition as the thermal dryer

council staff were now examining the citys infrastructure with a finetooth comb he said

we should be doing what they are doing which is the equivalent of a warrant for your motor vehicle and when your mechanic comes to you with a list of things that need to be done for you to be able to drive the same thing should be done for our infrastructure

and we know we wouldnt get a warrant and actually councils across new zealand wouldnt get a warrant

holdom blamed lack of investment from successive councils for the perilous state of the new plymouths infrastructure

we havent focused on the core infrastructure because councils have been driven by political imperatives looking at other issues keeping rates down you know

theres no requirement to undertake a warrant of fitness for your wastewater network or your water network its bizarre

whanganui mayor hamish mcdouall said holdom was onto a good idea

its not the sexy stuff you know you lay a pipe and it doesnt get you hundreds of votes so the political atmosphere doesnt always favour doing the basic core infrastructural work

however mcdouall was not sure of the term warrant of fitness

but id agree that every single council should be very transparent about the lacking in investment and every single council should be able to present to the public okay this is what we need to spend to this point

to do an audit and to be very transparent about that is i think a core function of local government

hitting the gym to lose a few extra pounds its likely youre not alone lapsed fitnessclub members typically return in january with new sign ups in february much to the annoyance of those workoutaholics who turn up whatever the season

but they may have less to complain about this year there are more and more fancy classes to choose from boxing is so hot right now that french fashion house balmain puma se and model cara delevingne have created a clothing line inspired by the ring at the other end of the spectrum workouts that are more primark than prada have rocketed

the legacy fitness operators are caught between these two trends trying everything they can to keep their members coming back in the uk where the number of health clubs exploded last year they span brands including virgin active david lloyd leisure and dw fitness first its the ultimate barbell economy if you like as an exercise market frenzy that began in the us shakes up the rest of the world

in the burgeoning nofrills sector you may not get a towel but for about 20 pounds a month you do get access to workout spaces equipment and classes in europe lowcost groups now account for half of the top 10 operators by revenue according to deloitte and europeactive and these are leading revenue growth competitors there include basicfit nv mcfit gmbh and in the uk pure gym and the gym group plc

theyve been able to take advantage of stress in shopping areas to add temples of sweat in the uk alone more 1000 retail spaces from blockbuster stores to post offices have been converted into gyms over the past five years according to the local data company

at the very top end pressure is coming from providers such as new yorkbased equinox the luxury fitness group thats a majority owner in soulcycle inc which has rolled into london and a new generation of home fitness options are trying to eliminate the need to go to the gym at all with personalized workout apps tracking your calorie burn in the privacy of your own home the mainstream providers many born out of the era when jane fondas workout was at the cutting edge must shape up too

all this pressure is a risk for investors especially private equity owners which will want to make a return and eventually seek an exit for brait se an investment holding company that owns virgin active this could be sooner rather than later brait said recently that a restructuring plan could lead to asset sales

virgin active has sold off many of its british clubs leaving it with 43 in metropolitan areas down from a peak of about 100 its focus on more affluent members who can afford to pay 20 pounds a pop for trendier classes elsewhere makes it particularly exposed to the studios sales in the uk were flat in the nine months to sept 30 but underlying earnings rose 115 thanks to cost savings to compete with the boutique crowd the company has been investing in boxing rings and machines for extreme pilates

however sales at its clubs in italy south africa and asia are growing any new owner may look to expand its asian footprint one winning strategy for legacy operators may be to concentrate on markets that are less crowded

david lloyd leisure one of europes largest gym groups by revenue has already taken this route it concentrates in the uk primarily on clubs with a family focus and racket sports mainly outside of london and is also expanding across europe consequently ebitda has more than doubled under tdr capitals sixyear ownership to 135 million pounds last year even so its experimenting with blaze a standalone studio with a highend nightclub vibe in birmingham to try to fight off the insurgents

but legacy fitness operators can take some comfort

as my colleague sarah halzack has noted studio concepts some of which are also attracting private equity interest flourished in a buoyant economy consumers pulling in the purse strings may take a different view of value and if clubs can sufficiently up their game a monthly gym fee might start to look more attractive than highpriced payasyougo aerial yoga classes the budget sector may be due for a shake up too there has already been significant consolidation led by pure gym and the gym group but there could be further reshaping as smaller operators feel the burn

the defender had been out since the end of august with a serious knee injury but has been tentatively reintroduced over the past few weeks starting clashes with sheffield united and west ham before being thrown in for citys trip to leicester

he is yet to last 90 minutes as he is eased back to full fitness however and there were real concerns about his condition when he trudged off the pitch before the hour mark at the king power stadium to be replaced by nicolas otamendi

while some assumed that his injury had once again reared its head guardiola said that the change was simply due to the players struggles to cope with an intense leicester attacking line and came at the request of the 25yearold

mail after confirming he would be available to face real madrid on wednesday

it was quite different against west ham on wednesday where they was only one striker so it was easier to control but hes ok

the 10500squarefoot facility in eagle opened last year and while owneroperator larry moore has brought several largescale events to the new gym few have had the excitement and crowds of the high school state championships

moore said about 450 to 500 climbers and their families had been in and out of the facility throughout the day on saturday many visiting eagle for the first time

among the firsttime visitors was 16yearold jack gowen of denver who was crowned state champion over the weekend

i was really surprised by the quality of the setting that they have here gowen said i wasnt expecting it to be that advanced within the setting technique but it really blew me away the amount of work that the setters were able to put in and the amount of creativity they were able to put into the climbs

gowens observations are a review moore has been wanting to hear as route setting has been a focus of the training at the eagle gym during the world cup bouldering event in vail in 2019 a group of route setters who were working the event put on a competition route setting clinic for the local workers

we timed it so we could have some of the best setters out there come to town just a little bit early host the routesetting clinic and then they were off to vail to start setting up the world cup moore said it has really added to our overall professionalism

only one route didnt get completed by competitors on saturday the sign of a perfect setup

its an art moore said its very challenging to not make it so hard that its not fun for the jv kids or too easy for the most advanced climbers

gowan said that the gym accommodated crowds well

i think that the gym did a really good job with the space that they had available to run a really efficient and wellrun comp he said

gowan started climbing when he was about 12 years old and has been participating in the scholastic league through the climbing program at kent denver since he was a freshman when he won regionals earlier this season it occurred to him that he might be able to put up a good result at the state championship as well

it stayed as a central idea in my mind but i tried not to focus on that goal of winning i tried to just focus on each individual climb and focus on figuring out each move in the sequence of the climb he said i really think that it helped me keep a level head and a straightforward view of the comp

gowan also participates in usa climbing a more competitive circuit than the american scholastic climbing league but one where athletes are not trying to achieve a team championship

high school climbing is a lot more relaxed a lot more strategy oriented he said

eagle countys top climber for the weekend battle mountain senior amalia manning finished her high school career on saturday with another podium at the state championship her third in four years

moore said between amalia manning her sister aiden manning and local climber sage eaton the team had a shot at winning state but eaton ended up taking a fall and breaking her ankle rendering her unable to compete at saturdays state championship

at the regional championship they beat the team that ended up winning state moore said so it was a really exciting season for them ; richmond va  the beginning of the year is a great time to evaluate your business banking needs its important for business owners to work with the right bank to meet their goals joining us this morning is david ring commercial banking group executive at atlantic union bank today he shares a bit about atlantic union a statewide richmondbased bank and the ways they support businesses and invest back into our local community visit atlantic union bank at 1051 e cary street in richmond or give them a call at 8009904828 you can also find them on the web at wwwatlanticunionbankcom or visit them on facebook atlanticunionbank or twitter atlantic _union

clearly jordyns got enough motivation for all of us ; manchester united boss ole gunnar solskjaer has delivered some upsetting news in regards to eric baillys fitness

the talented ivorian recently returned from injury to feature superbly vs chelsea helping his side keep a cleansheet in a 20 win

united would then go on to lock horns with club brugge in the round of 32 firstleg tie in the europa league

bailly didnt play but it was initially believed solskjaer was protecting his player ahead of a crucial clash vs watford

instead the legendary norwegian revealed the former villareal man suffered a knock vs the blues putting his position to star vs the london club under threat

if bailly was deemed not fit to start vs club brugge then it begs the questions why he travelled at all and why he was even put on the bench

perhaps it was due to a lack of options but it certainly wouldve been wiser to leave him out entirely especially due to his injury record

bailly was impressive vs chelsea and manchester united probably couldve done with his presence vs brugge as the tie ended in a disappointing 11 draw ; after 15 predictable years adam blairs brain and body have been woken up by a timely nrl coaching change at the warriors

fresh off a world cup campaign with the wallabies and there for the womens rugby sevens olympic gold in rio new zealand product twentyman has encouraged change since replacing alex corvo as head of performance

a lowkey walkthrough on game eve will replace the highintensity captains run while sessions have been shorter sharper and with more ball work to improve the warriors skill execution under duress

ive been around 15 years and trained the same way for a lot of that time but theres a new philosophy at the club this year blair said

its made me use my brain and start thinking more after 15 years of muscle memory doing the same stuff

its an eye opener to a lot of the parts of the body i havent used properly compared to preseason in the past where i havent had to think because my body knew whats coming

so i feel ready to go happy refreshed and excited to see what the year brings

granada cf local muscle vibration gives andalusians best injury record in spanish football when victor lafuente was appointed as the fitness coach at granada in the 201819 season as a member of diego martinezs coaching staff he proved instrumental in the clubs promotion from laliga smartbank last time round granada has the thirdlowest salary limit in laliga and is in a restructuring process initiated by the arrival of chinese owner jian lizhang in 2016

theyre doing things the right way though even spending time as laliga santander leaders following promotion from the second tier this summer and only having spent six seasons in the top flight in the last 44

amongst other feats the andalusian outfit promoted cause they registered the best injury record in the professional ranks of the spanish game last term picking up just five muscular injuries throughout the whole campaign and just a single hamstring injury

this record is partly down to the revolutionary local muscle vibration treatment which was introduced into the clubs fitness regime by lafuente a pioneer and visionary fitness expert within the european game

it all started back in 2016 recalls lafuente i was looking for a muscle activation training course and came across neuromecánica lab who looked at things from a neurological approach my dad had alzheimers and that was what initially prompted me to look at how the brain works another reason behind it was my interest in finding out why many players suffer injury relapses

and i discovered that injuries not only affect the body on a musculoskeletal level but that they also impact on neurological mechanisms whilst you might recover physically from an injury there are still neurological changes which can end up causing a recurrence of that injury

we tend to think its a case of just improving your strength but really everything goes through a primary process where the brain dictates and organises things any kind of neurodegenerative illness ultimately means that even when your muscles can be healthy if your brain doesnt coordinate the signals received that it has to send to the muscles then the muscles arent activated as the context demands an injury causes a neurological change because theres an interruption to the process that carries the signal to the sensor and motor cortex and on to the muscle this whole circuit is affected

local muscle vibration which is achieved using various different devices works a particular muscle helping to reorganise and reconnect the neurological circuits its not enough for the muscle to be healthy the brain also has to be aware that its healthy the teams injury record from last season speaks volumes of the therapys effectiveness indeed the system is beginning to take root across spanish and european football both to assist injury recovery and activation prior to training sessions and matches at granada where everything is done with meticulous detail the technique is used on a daily basis

grounded on a similar theory another neuropriming tool being employed at granada involves visualisation which is very much ontrend due to the recent rise of virtual reality the club turned to the technique when treating longterm injury victim quini it involves getting the player to imagine himself back out on the pitch and in tiptop condition the technique is producing good results with the club recognising the role its playing in the defenders recovery

one vital ingredient in all of this is the collaboration between departments one of the major programmes rolled out at granada again relating to neurological processes is how the club studies players sleep led by manuel arroyo a member of the medical department and an expert in whats called sleepfit the guidelines offered to all squad members to improve the quality of their sleep sparked dressing room competitions to see who got the best nights sleep even despite these guidelines including factors like the temperature the light in the room and the use of mobiles before sleeping its all in the name of optimising player performance

rcd mallorca measuring fatigue with heart rate variability and monitoring performance even in training games through gps

mallorca are the exception to the rule in the world of football just two seasons ago the islanders were competing in the spanish third tier and now theyre mixing it with the countrys big boys in laliga santander even managing to get the better of powerhouses such as real madrid and valencia one man who has had a big hand in the clubs meteoritic rise which involved backtoback promotions is former sevilla fc and zenit st petersburg fitness coach dani pastor who boasts 20 years of experience in the field the enthusiastic pastor is in his element as a member of vicente morenos backroom staff and feels very much at home at mallorca a club thats strongly committed to enhancing its players performance levels and wellbeing

the influence and vast experience of the clubs board of directors which features robert sarver the majority shareholder at the nbas phoenix suns since 2004 and steve nash a living nba legend is plain for all to see as mallorca rose up through the leagues the clubs facilities improved to the current enviable levels of professionalism boasted by the son moix outfit indeed as pastor reveals the setup at mallorca is far better than those at many bigger clubs instead of bringing methodologies and equipment back from russia i ended up taking things out to saint petersburg

amongst all of the methodologies in place pastor highlights one thats not all that common heartbeat variability to measure player fatigue im a bit wary of using gps when it comes to studying sleep with everything that we already get the players to do it might be too much to ask getting them to wear the vests in bed too jokes pastor instead of using gps technology the club employs very basic software that features a band receptor which takes all of three minutes to measure heartbeat variability

theres a time interval between heartbeats and the greater the consistency in this time interval the greater the level of fatigue the software itself produces a variability percentage that we can assess we run this test two or three times a week before breakfast when the players arrive at the training ground reveals pastor this is a fine example of an effective approach thats not overly invasive

in addition to this routine pastor uses other devices which are more widely found across laliga one such example is a system that measures strength and power in inertial machinery using conical pulleys to be specific

this kit is more advanced than your traditional gym machinery given that its able to replicate many movements that are similar to those carried out during games the club also has a jump platform which is extremely useful when it comes to vertical jumps both to measure performance and possible asymmetries upon landing which could point to an injury meanwhile the club is also reliant on the widely used gps technology

such is the scrutiny with which the information collected by gps technology is handled that even training games and lighthearted exercises are likely to be analysed we recently did a footballtennis drill on that particular day there were major levels of asymmetry in the number of impacts because of course the impact is usually just on one leg so thats now something we bear in mind in case the footballtennis activity is overloading the supporting leg although the impact isnt intense explains pastor theres certainly no hiding place from footballs answer to big brother gps technology ; no need to worry about buying costly equipment that provides the same therapeutic rehabilitative benefits this foam roller massage mobility kit aids in increasing circulation throughout the entire body improves muscle strength while preventing injuries and helps to enhance overall cellular function and healing it rolls away deep muscle knots that are hard to reach such as the balls of your feet great to use for stretching exercise recovery from sports injury and chronic pain mobility trigger point massage and deep tissue every piece of this therapeutic athletic tools kit is valuable and effective our therapy roller kit helps alleviate various musculoskeletal issues like plantar fasciitis shin splints runners legs  tennis elbow and other muscle related pains in the body

in the video boosie tells his 69m followers do not go to planet fitness they racist they haters they just put me out planet fitness for what i said about dwyane wade son misgendering zaya

boosie then adds that the gym also referenced another of his videos in which he reportedly referred to one of the employees with a homophobic slur in its decision to ask him to leave

laura schmitts enthusiasm and love of running is infectious she is a cofounder of thoroughbred an extremely popular new treadmill studio startup with a cultlike following the brand appeals broadly from folks just starting to run to elite running athletes with community and kindness as core values of the company thoroughbred is taking the fitness industry by storm

schmitt spent 35 years coaching high school cross country and track teams before cofounding thoroughbred with her son and elite runner jake schmitt in 2016 their next thoroughbred location is opening on san franciscos polk street in march 2020 recently i spoke with schmitt about her entrepreneurial journey love of running community building and her advice for other founders here are highlights from our conversation

hayley leibson what was your journey to founding thoroughbred

laura schmitt i went to redwood high school and cal uc berkeley and ran at both schools the year i graduated cal i came back to redwood and became the head cross country and track and field coach running is a huge part of my life i coached for 35 years

way before founding thoroughbred i was looking at preschools for my oldest son jake i decided to open my own school called marin enrichment that was my first real business that i opened and its been in existence now for 30 years and we still have all of the same staff i really went through all the unglamorous trials and tribulations of starting your own business the late nights and early mornings figuring out what works and doesnt with people budgeting etc

fast forwarding twenty years  my son jake ended up having an incredible entrepreneurial spirit and we would go on runs and talk about different business ideas they all tied into running he graduated from the university of washington seattle and we talked about starting a treadmill studio business nothing like that existed in california

jake decided to go to salesforce and work in marketing he came to me two years later and said mom i want to do thoroughbred i was 100 in i knew this was the right thing and didnt hesitate jake was willing to leave a career an income and all of the joys of working in san francisco in order to take on this venture we opened the first studio in 2016

leibson what were the early days of thoroughbred like

schmitt we were working around the clock we made a plan for the business and started looking for real estate we wanted our first location to be in marin because we both coached together at redwood and this is our community we found a building and went from there

it was hard we ran out of money and our family ended up having to paint the upstairs of the studio ourselves thats what starting your own business looks like you need an incredible amount of perseverance you have to look forward and expect unexpected things to come your way everyone is going to give you their opinion

you also have little blitzes of success for example the first time we had a class sellout and people were waiting outside the door when this happened i thought oh my god i want to start crying this is going to work weve had people finish our classes and cry while thanking us these things make you realize why you started the business

leibson has your relationship changed with your son since becoming cofounders what has that experience been like

schmitt i 100 believe in jake and not just because hes my son he has qualities that i know should be shared with others i know when hes talking to someone hes using the conduit of running but communicating so much more he connects with others on a level that really benefits people were very fortunate in that regard

leibson how do you think of community building for thoroughbred

schmitt jake and i spent so much time incubating what we wanted to give our community and we wanted to be careful that we didnt just attract elite runners our goal was to attract everyone we want to give everyone the joy of running that elite runners already receive its our opinion that everyone can run  even people who think they cant run everyone can have the elite experience our objective with thoroughbred is to give everyone the same experience that an elite olympian athlete receives

at thoroughbred we have track practice outside tuesday mornings rain or shine we have nonelite and elite runners like jake all running together and you know what they all get the same benefits and joy when i was a coach at redwood my goal was to have the best runner in the county state and nation training with the person whos going to finish the county league in last place i want to coach the gamut

leibson what is your fitness and nutrition philosophies at thoroughbred

schmitt we believe everyone is an athlete everyone who works for us is a coach not an instructor so if you walk into our door and take a class from there on out youre an athlete people start believing in themselves get more excited about it and start to have results

with regards to nutrition we answer questions and have group talks what we dont do is preach if someone wants to eat a hamburger theyre going to eat a hamburger and god bless them were not going to tell someone that a food is bad for them rather were going to introduce foods that are good for them whether youre a high school athlete collegiate athlete or just a person wanting to feel better  im not going to tell you not to eat a hamburger or not to do something im going to say hey i feel great and this is what eat it works beautifully thats how i operate

leibson any tips on hiring

schmitt i majored in psychology deliberately to be able to connect with people how you connect with someone is the most important element of hiring because how a person connects with me is how theyre going to connect with other people in our business if someone doesnt know something i can teach that what is challenging to teach is kindness thats what we hire for

leibson what books do you recommend

schmitt rich roll is great for the climate right now he made a big change in his life and i think thats wonderful he showed that it doesnt matter who you are you can make a change in your life if youre trying to become a better runner read jack daniels  hes more scientific and runningbased how not to die is a great nutrition book the movie that just came out called game changers is so inspirational deana kastors let your mind run is a great book on setbacks and how she found the love of running if you have the love of running every day is a success im very competitive and in the right arena i want to win i want my athletes to win but thats not the end all and at the end of the day youve got to love what youre doing

leibson you knew from an early age you wanted to be an entrepreneur how did that factor play into choosing a life partner

schmitt i met my husband tom at a high school track meet i just saw him and thought hes a gorgeous human being racing i would like to date him when we started dating he knew i was entrepreneurial he is the most steady stable contributing and giving human being hes like a quiet storm from the get go id wake up and say to him i think im going to do x business he would say that sounds great lets do it he was my biggest supporter

we started out with no money we had my son jake when i was in graduate school and i wanted to start a business we would funnel money into that business and tom was working fulltime and putting part of his money into whatever ridiculous thing i was doing he trusted me and we are both each others biggest supporters his entire life and career he has been there for all of the kids 100

leibson any other advice you would like to share

schmitt i speak about delayed gratification a lot its a big component of my coaching delayed gratification is an incredible motivator for me and underutilized in my opinion take some quiet time for yourself surround yourself with people are doing good and being kind never once did jake or i say to each other lets make a bunch of money when i opened my school i never once think or say that rather i wanted to surround myself with people who are doing good and being kind and give something of myself to my community ; fitness model krissy cela showed off her enviably sculpted physique in the latest video on her instagram page in the shared selfie clip the brunette beauty kneeled on a bedroom floor while wearing a sports bra and matching briefs early on in the video she lifted the sports bra up a bit to reveal even more of her chiseled midsection she later flexed the biceps on her right arm before throwing up a peace sign and making a goofy grin

the secret to getting in shape isnt motivation its discipline according to former navy seal commander john jocko willink

building discipline like building muscle takes work if you want to achieve both of those things willink recommends getting up early and doing 100 burpees first thing in the morning

that kind of discipline will extend through everything else that you do he told insider we make excuses that we dont have enough time to work out or train or gym but we need to make time for it

willink who had two decades of experience in the us navy before retiring in 2010  including as lieutenant commander of an elite special operations seal team  has made his career about teaching discipline publishing books like new york times bestseller extreme ownership coauthored with fellow seal retiree leif babin

doing 100 burpees at 5 am isnt the only way to build a strong body and mind willink also recommends that you never skimp on squats for one thing heres what else the former elite seal commander advises for setting goals and sticking to them both in and out of the gym

discipline is distinct from motivation which is many people mistakenly think they need to get to the gym or eat healthier willink said

people want motivation but its an emotion like being happy or sad or frustrated it comes and goes he said if you wait to be motivated to work out or eat whats good for you youre not going to do it when you need to

discipline on the other hand is a structure that you actively maintain in your life according to willink

you can count on discipline because its a structure in your life that you put into place you can own it you impose it he said

willinks motto is discipline equals freedom  for example the better you manage your money the more youll have leeway to spend it on things you want he said the same is true of health

if you want the freedom of being mobile moving your body and not getting sick you have to have discipline with your health willink said

part of health includes good nutrition willink said his brand jocko fuel recently partnered with vitamin shoppe to make his supplement products widely available

willink said he developed the products  which include protein powder and a premission energy formula available as a powder or canned drink based on what he needed for his own daily exercise routines including jiu jitsu

i used to just hodgepodge other products together to get what i needed and decided to just do it myself willink said

but its not just for people in combat or combat sports he added whatever youre using to fuel your daily activities willink recommends avoiding anything with a lot of caffeine added sugar or artificial ingredients

everyone needs fuel whether thats to go to work to the gym to a meeting everyone needs to perform every day he said but people are also busy so having something convenient making it easier to stick to that discipline

the fitnessgram test has been in california since 1996 and it measures six components aerobic capacity onemile run abdominal strength upper body strength body mass index trunk lift and flexibility

the test is dolled out each year to students in grades 59 and they must pass at least five of the six categories

its something that can be body shaming something that can raise issues for kids who may not have the same type of physical fitness ability depending on their family where they live what their resources are says jill tucker education reporter for the san francisco chronicle

she explains that gov newsom is suggesting a threeyear pause to this testing to see if its the best way to measure kids fitness and if its worth changing

what does it mean to be fit

tucker says theres a lot more research since 1996 in terms of what fitness means and how we measure it

it also depends on resources she explains do kids live in places with parks and sports programs is it safe enough to play outside can kids access nutritious food do they have credentialed pe teachers

many kids dont like pe but they do like to play sports and games or do some kind of physical activity why cant we bridge the two

pe has made great strides in recent years and teachers are introducing a lot more than sort of the old school volleyball football basketball or whatever they had  theyre introducing yoga theyre introducing ballroom dancing says tucker

she notes that it all depends on resources and even the physical nature of the school like whether they have grass

its very different than pe that i took years ago i think that theres a lot more creativity  but it isnt equal in terms of how thats being implemented she says

written by amy ta produced by rosalie atkinson ; london only a fraction of people who run do so because they love it and most are motivated by boosting their body image and improving their heart and mental health according to a global survey by the fitnesstracking app strava

strava which tracks the sports activity trends of some 50 million people in almost 200 countries surveyed 25000 runners and found that half of them say they either hate it or barely tolerate it while only 8per cent love it

but running is often connected with a sense of stability at a deeper level strava said in a report of the surveys findings runners described the need to run to maintain their sense of self and as a way to respond to adversity

theres a great realisation that to exercise the body also helps to exercise the mind  which is a muscle that needs just as much looking after as the other muscles said simon klima stravas global marketing director

and love it or hate it the vast majority of runners cited health as a primary motivator for getting out and clocking up the miles more than 80per cent said they started running to get healthier stronger or have more energy

in brazil 22per cent of amateur runners said theyd taken up the sport due to a health scare that compares with just 2per cent in the united states there almost half of respondents said building strength was a core motivator to run  and this was even higher  at 54per cent  among us women

german runners were the most likely of the nations surveyed to cite body image as a reason to run  at 47per cent  and in japan 15per cent say they run to combat feelings of anxiety and depression

klima sees this as a sign of the times with social media networks putting pressure on people for how they look its driving up the motivating factor of body image he said

the why we run survey  which included respondents from nine countries in north america south america asia and europe  showed how runners worldwide share many common traits

it clustered runners into five key types based on the benefits they value and the extent to which they race or run in social groups

they ranged from passionate runners who run in many social settings and reap the psychosocial benefits like accomplishment and happiness to mindful runners  who tend to run alone  to reluctant runners who rarely compete in races and perceive the fewest social or psychological benefits of all runner types

reporting by kate kelland editing by mitch phillips and hugh lawson ; as much as runners like to think of themselves as hardcore exercise enthusiasts a few studies have questioned whether theyre as fit as theyd like us to believe

the first blemish on their reputation was in 2014 when a study of recreational marathoners and half marathoners revealed they spent eight to 10 hours of their day sitting based on that lifestyle the studys authors suggested recreational distance runners were simultaneously highly sedentary and highly active

a few years later another study reported that 32 per cent of runners polled didnt meet the recommended 150 minutes of moderate to vigorousintensity exercise per week

the latest blow to their reputation comes with the disclosure that injured runners would rather put their feet up than find an alternative workout routine instead of preserving their fitness by hitting the pool or the gym they wait until their pain or injury subsides enough to get back to pounding the pavement

anyone who knows runners shouldnt be surprised at their tendency to stick with what they know even if that means losing some of their hardearned fitness due to inactivity runners often to their detriment are creatures of habit they revel not just in the sameness of putting one foot in front of the other but also in the ease of lacing up a pair of shoes and heading out the door  no gym membership equipment or experienced trainer required

the authors of this latest study published in medicine  science in sports  exercise suspected that runners were too set in their ways to explore new exercise options while recovering from an injury reaching out to local runners and running groups they recruited 49 people 30 women and 19 men who agreed to wear an activity tracker during their waking hours as well as report weekly on their injury and pain status the goal was to get an accurate look at just how active runners really are as well as how injuries affected their workout habits

the study logged the number of active and inactive hours the runners accumulated over the course of 52 weeks and how often they took time off due to injury it also noted the level of pain runners experienced on a scale of 0 to 10 ranging from no pain to the worst pain imaginable and whether the pain was such that they cancelled or reduced their planned running sessions for the week

the results revealed runners averaged 586 minutes a day of moderate to vigorous activity the fitbit categorizes activity by intensity not type with only one perfect week no report of injury or pain recorded almost half the runners 469 per cent were injured for at least one week and four of the runners didnt accumulate the recommended 150 minutes of moderate to vigorous exercise per week

injured runners experienced a decrease in physical activity of about 14 minutes per day which the researchers suggest was due to not fully replacing their lost running time with other forms of moderate to vigorous physical activity interestingly runners who reported pain didnt experience the same drop in daily activity suggesting that runners often opt to run through pain  which provides some redemption for their hardcore reputation

what does this mean for the running community with statistics suggesting 80 per cent of runners will suffer an injury its worthwhile coming up with a strategy that increases the chances of returning to running stronger and fitter than before a forced break even if that means settling on an activity that isnt as accessible or doesnt spark the same kind of joy as running the goal is to turn an injury timeout into an opportunity not a loss

to be clear taking a break from running isnt necessarily a bad thing in fact its often one of the best strategies to becoming a better runner  especially if it means working on weaknesses that are often ignored instead of putting in more training miles but its also important to keep those hardearned fitness gains from diminishing especially since runners almost always try to start back where they left off which isnt always a good strategy when recovering from an extended layoff

good options for injured runners include joining a masters swim group or hiring a personal trainer to design an exercise program that retains fitness without aggravating an injury also worthy of consideration is starting a strength training program designed not only to address any weaknesses but to reduce the loss of muscle due to aging

then theres another issue with runners understating the amount of time they spend being sedentary like most people in todays workforce much of the day is spent sitting the health consequences of which arent totally erased by a daily run no matter how much ground is covered the bottom line is that runners need to do more than just run if they want to be at their fittest ; theodore is ground zero in a couples bid to start a fitness revolution in their community

triathlon and fitness coaches joshua and salome duff from smurf and smurfette have brought a new fitness challenge to the shire the malakoff mountain madness

for more head to the smurf and smurfette facebook page ; cape town  proteas assistant coach enoch nkwe has confirmed batsmen temba bavuma and heinrich klaasen will undergo a fitness test later on tuesday ahead of their third t20 against australia at newlands on wednesday

bavuma suffered a hamstring strain which he picked up during the decider of the threematch series against england in centurion while klaasen suffered a right hip injury during the teams warmup session ahead of the t20i series opener against australia in johannesburg

nkwe said the team did miss bavuma at the top of the order

he said they would have to adapt if bavuma would not be available

we do miss him but we have a big squad and good enough players that are flexible to bat in different positions said nkwe

weve looked at it as an opportunity also to see which other players are adapting to different positions temba has been playing well so hopefully hell be back in the mix as soon as possible  as soon as he is fit  but if hes not available well look at whats best for these conditions in cape town

nkwe has also spoken about certainty in the team saying no ones place in the team was guaranteed ahead of the t20 world cup later this year

i dont think anyone is certain for any positions to be honest  we still have a long way to the world cup theres plenty of games in the squad it is big squad we still have sri lanka coming we still got west indies and pakistan down the line ; if youre looking for a new pair of true wireless earbuds to soundtrack your workout but you cant or dont want to stretch to the apple airpods the latest buds from kygo could make a compelling alternative

the e71000 true wireless waterproof earbuds are one of a number of new headphones launched by the norwegian djs audio brand which also include two pairs of noisecancelling headphones

the company is quickly making a name for itself following the launch of the kygo life a11800 last year which we awarded four out of five stars in our recent review thanks to their good sound quality comfortable fit and decent battery life

the new true wireless earbuds come with an ipx7 waterproof rating which means they should easily withstand a sweaty workout or a little rain while running  for comparison neither the airpods or airpods pro come with an official waterproof rating although apple says theyre sweat and waterresistant

kygos airpod alternatives also come with foam tips and sports wings or ear fins if you prefer which should provide a secure fit during even the most vigorous aerobics session

the earbuds come with a sixhour battery life while the charging case provides a further 24 hours of charge  thats not the best battery life weve seen but the earbuds do surpass both airpods models

the kygo buds come with multitouch buttons that you can use to control the volume and playback of your music as well as call functions  judging from the press pictures it looks as though these are physical buttons rather than touchsensitive housings

that kind of design can be divisive some people like the tactile feedback of pressing a button while others dislike the sensation of pushing the earbuds further into their ears every time they want to change the volume

each bud contains a 6mm driver but we dont know much else about the sound quality just yet  well need to test them to see if the kygo e71000s can truly stand up to the apple airpods

however at 80 about 100  au150 they could be a compelling cheaper alternative to the airpods and while they dont come with premium features like the noisecancellation seen in the sony wf1000xm3s the specs suggest that the e71000s could make a decent pair of running earbuds ; differences in health policy werent the only bones presidential candidates had to pick last week they also sparred over details of their personal health and with the next debate and super tuesday primaries fast approaching these skirmishes are likely to escalate

in the runup to the las vegas democratic presidential primary faceoff vermont sen bernie sanders national press secretary briahna joy gray told cnn that opponents are trying to use his october heart attack against him then she mistakenly claimed that mike bloomberg has suffered heart attacks in the past  a statement she quickly walked back after a bloomberg adviser said in a tweet it was a trumpy lie

he did not have a heart attack bloombergs camp explained trying to differentiate its candidates health status he had stents the former new york mayor according to the campaign had coronary stents inserted two decades ago after a cardiac test indicated they might be useful

feathers still ruffled the two candidates went at it again on the debate stage

i think the one area maybe that mayor bloomberg and i share you have two stents as well sanders said thursday to his rival onstage

bloomberg responded twentyfive years ago

its not surprising with the oldest crop ever of presidential candidates that their vital signs are becoming a talking point

when it comes to politics personal health is just one more issue to try and leverage said arthur caplan a professor of bioethics at nyu school of medicine in new york city

that got us wondering how this information fits into the facts voters weigh and in evaluating a candidates longterm health or electability does it really matter whether a patient got a stent as part of treatment for a heart attack like sanders or for another reason such as to relieve chest pain or following a cardiac stress test like bloomberg

in this day and age with the way technology has advanced and the skill sets of the cardiologists i would say they are practically the same we expect good results for both said dr hadley wilson a practicing cardiologist in charlotte north carolina and a member of the american college of cardiologys board of trustees

stents are almost always used when a person is having a heart attack

heart attacks can occur when plaque breaks off inside the blood vessels of the heart causing a blockage to open the blocked artery physicians insert stents which are small wiremesh tubes afterward patients are treated with medications to reduce the risk of subsequent heart attacks

back when bloomberg got his they were commonly used in nonemergency situations to prop open narrowing arteries with the thought that might prevent a heart attack said dr suzanne steinbaum a cardiologist in new york and a spokesperson for the american heart association

but since then we learned stents dont prevent a heart attack and that using medication might be equally beneficial steinbaum said adding that the best preventive measures are lifestyle choices such as eating a good diet exercising and not smoking patients still sometimes get stents to alleviate symptoms such as chest pain or for other reasons

thursdays debate also highlighted the broader question just how much of a candidates medical history is fair game for public consumption

sanders who faced criticism in october for delays in reporting his condition said he has since released the full report of that heart attack  including letters from his primary care doctor and two cardiologists attesting to his overall health and recovery

but candidate pete buttigieg the former mayor of south bend indiana said sanders had not provided enough detail  and neither he said had the others

under president obama the standard was that the president would release full medical records do a physical and release the readout he said during the debate now president trump lowered that standard he said just a letter from a doctor is enough and a lot of folks on this stage are now saying thats enough

buttigieg himself has yet to provide a full medical record

but i am certainly prepared to get a physical put out the results he said during the debate i think everybody here should be willing to do the same

some observers agree theres no such thing as tmi too much information when it comes to potus the president of the united states

when the country is hiring someone to have their finger on the nuclear button the expectation of personal privacy is very very limited said david blumenthal head of the commonwealth fund and coauthor of the heart of power health and politics in the oval office its hard to imagine something healthrelated that would not be relevant

that argument though doesnt always hold up

when he ran for president in 2008 the then70yearold sen john mccain released more than 1000 pages of his medical records

by contrast the campaigning donald trump initially released a glowing letter from his personal physician that concluded he would be the healthiest individual ever elected to the presidency after criticism that the letter lacked specifics trump added information on his height weight and cholesterol levels and went on to become the oldest president at age 70 to take office beating out ronald reagan who was just weeks shy of that milestone on inauguration day in 1981

this year candidates bloomberg and sanders are both 78 former vice president joe biden 77 and sen elizabeth warren 70 sen amy klobuchar is 59 and buttigieg is the youngest at 38

anything that might be relevant to a candidates ability and competence to govern and their longevity of service should be disclosed said blumenthal who is also a medical doctor

voters could then decide what they thought was important the information might also affect how voters view the choice of a vice president especially if the candidate for the highest office had a serious illness or something else that might limit their term he said

specifically which records though and how to release them is a complicated issue

caplan at nyu has long advocated setting up a special independent medical panel to evaluate presidential candidates health  and make their findings public

it would be like an executive physical which is what a lot of companies do before they pick a ceo he said

and deciding what to test for would be in itself complicated without a special panel  which even caplan admits would meet political inertia  the challenges would be numerous even locating all the necessary records would be difficult

the candidates may have moved around the country their doctors may have died or records may not be available noted lawrence altman who covered many presidential elections as a reporter for the new york times and is now a global scholar at the woodrow wilson international center for scholars

while there is no specific requirement that candidates release any information at all what readers  and voters  want to know varies widely

it depends on their interest in the candidate altman said a lot of people superimpose their political choices or feelings on the medical aspect they are willing to dismiss something if they really like the candidate or make a big issue about it if they dont like the candidate ; of course the womens singles would definitely be a prospect with sindhu being there gopichand

pullela gopichand has been the guiding light behind indian badmintons success in the past decade as his academy has helped train the likes of saina nehwal pv sindhu and srikanth kidambi

gopichand and saina nehwal may have had their differences in the past but the india badminton coach has admitted that his star pupil is definitely a medal prospect with even a 10 percent improvement in her present state

saina nehwal who is ranked 22nd will need to be placed within the top 16 by the end of the qualification period which comes in april to be assured of a place in the indian contingent that goes to tokyo

saina with not great improvement in fitness i think even a 10 percent improvement in her present state is definitely a medal prospect she has the ability to beat the best players in the world she on the big stage with decently better health and fitness is certainly a medal prospect for us gopichand said on the latest episode of india today inspiration

so the 1st priority would be to qualify and get to the olympics as many numbers as possible i believe that each member of the team who goes to the olympics from our country has a chance of winning a medal

of course the womens singles would definitely be a prospect with sindhu being there also our mens singles with sai praneeth doing well at the world championships its a field that is pretty much the same if any the field at olympics is actually simpler than the world championship there is a possibility that our singles players will win a medal there our doubles players have been doing well

i wouldnt rule out anything but having said that its a very competitive field everybody is going to be prepared for that big event god willing we started this journey in 2008 in beijing with a quarterfinal a bronze in 2012 we got a silver in 2016 and hopefully a gold here is what i would hope for ; the model sizzled in her figurehugging workout gear

the former world number one is sidelined again through injury this time pelvic bruising that has kept him out of action since november with no indication yet when he will be able to make his comeback

providing he can find a solution to the problem which has restricted him to work in the gym it is looking increasingly likely murray may not compete  at the top level anyway  until the grasscourt season

time is fast running out for him to play on hard courts while clay which he has not played on since his hip problems emerged in 2017 is the most demanding surface physically

that could mean a return at queens club where he played for the first time following hip surgery in 2018 and again in 2019 after his second operation although only in doubles

the 31yearold has been sidelined since august when he suffered a serious knee injury during the canaries league cup defeat to league two outfit crawley town

after a six month injury layoff klose is hoping to boost daniel farkes central defensive options by returning to the fold quicker than anticipated

the injury is at its final stage and were looking at around a week and then im hopefully fully back with the squad and ready to go out there again and compete he explained

its a great feeling to be out there again and running around with no pain anymore its been a long time about six months now in total

they told me that it could be an end of the season thing but im happy i came back faster and im looking strong fit and im looking forward to going out there again

klose was a major protagonist in the opening half of citys titlewinning championship campaign before a less severe knee injury halted his progress

speaking after a signing session at the clubs fan hub at jarrold intersport in norwich city centre on friday klose revealed his spell on the sidelines has been difficult to process mentally

the start was very hard because i had a lot of plans i wanted to show everyone after the halfseason i had in the championship when i already struggled with my knee that im back fit again and i sorted the knee out and then unfortunately there was another injury to it he said

i played pretty much every game until january last year and then all of a sudden i had this stuff with my knee it started last year actually

then you get promoted and youre looking forward to playing in the premier league and then you get benched or sidelined thats hard you see the team out there fighting for every point and you want to help

farke has seen his defensive options limited due to reoccurring injuries to his key operators christoph zimmermann is the latest injury concern for city with the towering german a major doubt for the canaries trip to wolves tomorrow 2pm kickoff with a hamstring injury ; just to remind you weve taken on a 12 week weight loss and fitness challenge with our friends at xtreme csc clonmel well be spending 12 weeks training clocking up the steps and following a tailored meal plan why because we like many many others across the county and beyond have no clue what to eat and when what choices to make when out for dinner and have no form of fitness whatsoever we want to educate ourselves on what to eat when and how much to train how to use gym equipment and above all lead by example and the saying goes if i can do it anyone can

this week was tough the shine and excitement of the first week had gone and motivation was hard to find we had to push ourselves each day to go but the main thing is we got there

one thing that were all finding hard out of all the changes is drinking the 34 liters of water a day that is recommended the easiest thing of all has now become the most difficult the easiest way ive found to combat that is to have a 2 liter bottle on my desk all the time and to set goals sounds silly i know but i aim to have over half the bottle gone by lunch and the other half gone by home time seems to be working so far

with the election coming up fran and lynda have been extremely busy and so finding time for the gym or getting the steps in is quite difficult at the moment but jola has taken that on board and has come up with quicker high intensity sessions for days that were caught for time

this week weight loss was really good again were also seeing inch loss too which is really motivating

thats a total of 7 pounds lost this week and a combined 16 pounds in total

what would we say to someone whos thinking about joining a gym for the first time go for it book in with jola for a personal training session and take the first step a personal trainer will be able to give you a plan to work on and most importantly if youve never been before will show you how to use the machines youll amaze yourself with your capabilities and believe us no one will be looking at you every single person is there for the same reason ; pandya will be under rehab at the nca until he regains full match fitness bcci

pandya recently flunked the bowling workload monitoring test which is one of the mandatory requirements after coming back from back surgery

pandya had told india today last month that the injury layoff period has been very emotionally challenging for him and he also misses being there with the indian team

it has been difficult coming back from an injury is not easy it looks easy when you see a guy coming back with nothing changed at all it looks easy but the process which follows is actually tough

right now i am seeing my team i am very happy they are winning everything but i miss being there its not being selfish but i feel like if i would have been there it would have not happened pandya had said on india today inspiration

also see ; saving money for emergencies is good advice and important for maintaining quality of life in the event of lost employment or other financial crisis while this may seem like common sense many people get caught without enough savings when they need it and find it difficult to meet basic needs

this principle can also be applied to fitness when you are healthy you can maintain a high level of fitness this makes your daytoday activities easier and serves as a reserve or bank to draw on when you need it your good fitness now can get you through a health crisis just like saving money can help you through a financial crisis this health crisis could come in the form of an injury or illness that keeps you from being active for several days or a hospitalization that keeps you in bed for a week a month or longer

the problem with periods of inactivity like bed rest or hospitalization is that there are severe physiological effects that occur within days and get worse over time you may have noticed this as weakness and fatigue after spending a few days in bed with a cold or the flu muscle strength declines with each day of bed rest and can be 50 lower following as little as three weeks that reduction in strength could limit a person who was already deconditioned to a point where he or she would have difficulty completing the most basic activities of daily living

a person who was fit and strong when they went into the hospital would certainly be better off when released older adults fare worse than younger individuals according to one study the decline in strength seen in older men in just 10 days was equivalent to the change measured after 28 days in men 30 years younger

its not just the muscles that are affected the bones get weaker too in fact 12 weeks of bed rest can reduce bone density by as much as 50 exposing patients to a greater risk of fracture this is due to the reduced stress on the bone from not standing and walking as well as the lack of muscle activity two of the most effective ways to build bone density are putting stress on bones through weightbearing activity and the action of the muscles pulling on the bones from resistance training because bed rest eliminates these stresses bone density declines rapidly

one unique study from the 1960s had healthy young men complete three weeks of bed rest they all experienced a rapid decline over 20 in their aerobic fitness but recovered quickly after the experiment ended these individuals also had their fitness tested again 30 years later it turns out that the decline in fitness in those young men in three weeks of bed rest was greater than the decline in fitness that occurred over 30 years of aging

the good news is that most patients are encouraged to move around as much as possible some receive inpatient physical therapy or rehab even after major surgery to help lessen the effects of prolonged bed rest it is important to take advantage of these opportunities if you or a loved one are hospitalized

there are many reasons to exercise and be fit but an important reason may be to develop a fitness bank you can draw on if you become injured or hospitalized since the effects of bed rest are seen in people of all ages everyone can benefit from a good fitness foundation just like putting money in the bank doing a little now can have great benefits later when you need it most ; the chief of army staff ltgen tukur yusuf buratai has charged personnel of the nigerian army to be physically fit in order to professionally carry out their constitutional roles

he stated this friday during the 15 kilometres route match organised by army headquarters garrison to round off the 2020 edition of the annual medical and physical efficiency test for personnel in abuja

buratai who was represented by the chief of army standard and evaluation majgen fidelis azinta said the essence of the exercise was held to know the percentage of officers and men that were fit to fight

he said physical fitness is one of the most important requirements for a successful military profession no army can ever be professional unless bulks of its men are physically fits

physical efficiency test is therefore organised annually to enable us know the percentage of our men that are fit to fight it is our responsibility to be fit to be able to carry out the duties assigned to us

i want to remind us that physical fitness is largely an individual responsibility it is not an event it is a continuous process therefore your job as an individual is to make sure you are fit to do the job assigned to you the system will create an enabling environment for you to train to be fit but obviously it is your responsibility to keep fit

continuing he said this therefore means that no matter the exigency of duties no matter the demands and the pressure that goes with your office you must find time to exercise

so the vision of the chief of army staff places a demand on us to be constantly conscious of the fact that we must be fit to be professional ; wyze has made its name by offering smart home gadgets at startlingly low prices compared to the bigname competitors the company is now looking to branch out into smart wearables with the wyze band it looks like a fairly standard fitness tracker but it sports amazon alexa integration and we assume a low price tag

wyze sells products that hover around the 20 level it has a 1080p security camera that rivals devices that cost five or ten times more it also offers an 8 smart bulb that can do most of the same things as a 30 philips hue bulb likewise wyzes 20 smart home sensor kit undercuts the competition and adds functionality to the companys other devices the smart home market is booming and theres no clear leader wyzes attempt to break into wearables will be hampered by an entrenched oligarchy

the company mentioned this new fitness wearable in a blog post about its upcoming products however it didnt include any details beyond the name however zatznotfunny managed to unearth some additional details from the beta wyze app the device looks a lot like the fitbit charge with its tall narrow screen built into the band the touchscreen will be color supporting custom backgrounds and various clock designs the display will probably be lcd considering wyzes commitment to low prices

the device will of course track fitness stats like heart rate and steps wyze will attempt to set its wearable apart from other budget offerings with alexa integration youll be able to control wyze devices from the wyze band but also all the other internetconnected gadgets that work with alexa theres a microphone but its unclear if youll have a speaker for verbal replies fitbit also added support for alexa to the versa 2 which didnt have a speaker however the future of that venture is unclear now that google is acquiring the company presumably future fitbit devices will have google assistant instead ; a scarboroughbased business owner who runs contracted fitness programs for elementary students has shifted to driving for uber after job action by ontario teachers gutted his usual work

following years of competing in multiple olympic and commonwealth games milt ottey shifted his experience as a champion to education for years his business ot fitness educational services has been contracted to run fitness programs in toronto schools

but amid a tumultuous school year that work has dried up

while waiting for a resolution between the province and teachers unions ottey has been paying the bills as an uber driver

but as much as ottey is enjoying the experience which has introduced him to interesting people hes growing concerned about the future of his business

during the 2015 worktorule campaign involving teachers ottey lost thousands of dollars i lost anywhere between 4550000 in business he said

i dont think its something you ever really recoup

on top of the lost revenue ottey said he also lost valuable staff

he had just begun to turn things around when work began to dry up ahead of the fall school year

a lot of the schools told me they said milt theres worktorule coming this is whats happening well look at it and well plan this after and see what happens with it said ottey

taking a positive approach he said is all he can do

but while hes driving people around the city he said he would much rather be transporting his athletic equipment to schools while he pays his bills with uber that gear is gathering dust in storage

its a tough one

ottey would like to get back to work next week but with a sigh he said impending escalations in job action are making that look more unlikely

while he hopes to pick up where he left off he said creditors are chomping at the bit which could make his business future uncertain ; in sports you constantly have to prove yourself well done abhinav bindra hails mary kom

an athlete is also a human being once we take care of wellbeing of an athlete then performance will automatically come an athlete is not a robot not a machine wellbeing of athletes is absolute necessary

when i turn up everything looks pretty normal at first exercise mats are laid out the instructor is stretching at the front and the speakers are playing zen music into the room but thats where the normality ends

instead of water bottles and sweat towels next to each mat is a squeaky toy or piece of rope instead of the scent of incense there is a slightly nasty whiff and instead of blocks and weights in the corner of the room there are 30 tiny puppies

this morning im taking part in puppy yoga and its exactly what it says on the dog food tin  yoga surrounded by eightweekold yorkshire terrier pups who are running around our feet with excitement to have so many people up at the crack of dawn to play with

the rise of animalthemed yoga has been steadily growing in the uk after dog yoga launched in the us in 2012 the benefits for humans are that playing with a puppy can elevate levels of serotonin and dopamine which help calm and relax

just one look at the puppies and im already the happiest ive ever been in an exercise class and we havent even started yet we all find a mat and the teacher tries to prise our attention away from the puppies to make a start broken down into sections we start with ten minutes of puppy play time

two puppies make a beeline for me and while one settles on my lap the other nibbles on my leggings we play tug of war with a rope before the pups on the mat next to me join in

when the ten minutes are up everyone in the class lets out a disappointed grumble before we get to our feet to do some actual exercise the 20minute yoga flow is surprisingly challenging

where any tough moves in a class are normally daunting having the puppies skidding around the floor makes everyone giggle which stops it ever getting too serious

once were done its time for a cuddle break thats right a scheduled ten minutes to feed our urge to give these puppies some more loving i carefully pick up a pup who wanders my way and my heart melts all over again when the little guy eventually falls asleep in my arms

i almost feel guilty when i have to wake him to finish off with a final ten minutes of yoga the event is hosted by gym brand contur and pets yoga but the growing trend has seen a wide range of different companies offering puppy yoga nationwide

staring down at the little puppy in the middle of my mat as i stretch around him its easy to see how the 35 sessions sell out in minutes online the moves our teacher maiken fortes puts us through avoid any arm balances which were told is for the puppies safety

the little pooches were playing with are provided by licensed breeders who want their litters to socialise before they are taken into homes the breeders also stay during the entire session to make sure the puppies are handled safely and correctly

they also clear up any accidents which surprisingly there were only two of during the hourlong class

sadly you dont all get a puppy to take home when the session is over of course puppies are not the first novelty to be introduced by the yoga world ive tried cat yoga goat yoga  hell ive even been to wine yoga  but this is the only one that ive walked out of feeling the happiest

there is something to be said about the warm stressfree feeling ive enjoyed after just an hour with puppies

the yoga was a good blast of stretching and toning first thing but the reason half of us exercise is to start the day right to destress or to leave with a buzz of endorphins

well if there is a better way to start the day than hanging out with a bunch of fluffy puppies then id love to try it ;  new ironman r300 gps launched  features hr gps and 25 day battery life  available now for 120

timex has launched an allnew ironman watch and this one is a smartwatch with gps heartrate monitoring and battery that can last up to an impressive 25 days

in a lot of ways its similar in spirit to the pebble watches from yesteryear in that it can mirror the notifications from your smartphone and connects to it via bluetooth and it does so on a relatively small square screen

with that said this is much more of a fitness focussed device than any pebble ever was

the built in heartrate sensor works together with the gps tracking to monitor your activities and the battery capabilities will ensure you can track even the most arduous and long training sessions

timex says you can get up to 25 days from the battery just using it as a smartwatch or up to 20 hours of straight activity tracking using the gps

if youre a long distance runner with training that goes on for hours at a time the new ironman gps watch should comfortably keep up with you

using the smartphone app you can send dedicated workouts to your watch including workout programs for 5k half or full marathons

once youve done a few sessions the watch and app can then show you how youre performing versus your best and inform you how your cardiovascular health is improving or not

digging down into the specifics the watch features a 405mm wide case with its body made predominantly from a durable resin material

its waterproof up to 30 metres has a silicone strap and fairly basic lcd colour screen similar to what youd find on a garmin watch

despite seemingly like a highly capable fitness focussed smartwatch from the information we have the watch costs significantly less than what youd find from garmin or other similar watches

timexs latest smart fitness wearable is available to purchase now in white grey or black for just 120 ; limericks declan hannon breaks clear of galways jason flynn

limerick manager john kiely has allayed any fears about the fitness of his captain declan hannon

in his first game of the season hannon was substituted less than five minutes into the second half of sundays allianz hurling league win over galway

but its nothing to keep the centre back sidelined long term according to the limerick manager

precaution more than anything at this time of the year if in doubt get them out because there are bigger games ahead and we have a panel available and fellas are mad for game time so often its just a welcome opportunity to get other fellas on the pitch said john kiely after the eight point win in the first limerickgalway meeting since the 2018 allireland shc final

declan is coming off the back of an ankle injury and we didnt want to give him too much time today  we just wanted to get him back on the pitch and motoring added kiely

fellow defender richie english was withdrawn at half time

they are not serious stressed kiely of the injuries

limerick have used 32 players in their 2020 season todate but kyle hayes and peter casey are among those yet to see game time along with previously confirmed longterm injured shane dowling and pat ryan

they are all close but they have little niggly things  kyle has a tendon thing in his ankle that is going to take a week or two to get right and then there are a couple like pat ryan shane dowling and peter casey who are a little more long term but hopefully be coming in the next few weeks as well outlined the limerick manager

limerick made seven changes between the tipperary and galway games and the manager insists that getting the correct balance between training and games is crucial to his teams freshness

it is just a case of being smart and making sure lads are ready and getting a balance across the group everyone is getting an opportunity but not being hammered at the same time said kiely

we only had 24 players togged out today because a lot of fellas had flu and fellas have a few niggly injuries and fellas have been playing fitzgibbon cup for the last few weeks and the u21 championship has started in limerick and the freshers championship has started and we have two in that with ul

next up for defending league champions limerick is the february 15 visit of waterford to the lit gaelic grounds in round three of the allianz hurling league ; the district court granted the employers request to dismiss the case but the 3rd circuit disagreed pointing out that the color of her skin appeared to be a factor in the decisions and that she was fired only hours after she told a manager that she had complained to the eeoc

experts have said that managers and supervisors are a leading cause of discrimination claims to reduce risk of legal action employers should adopt antidiscrimination policies and make sure that managers are trained on workplace policies periodic training on federal state and local laws on bias and retaliation is also important for those in supervisory roles a robust reporting system can help too experts have said hr can also examine corporate culture and develop business ethics and conduct that support a diverse workplace

employers should be also careful when an adverse employment action follows on the heels of protected activity such as filing a complaint with the eeoc unless they have a legitimate nondiscriminatory reason for the action sources previously told hr dive a short period of time between the protected activity and an adverse employment action can create an inference of retaliation the appeals court noted that pedros claim of retaliation was supported by the fact that there was only hours between the firing and her informing club leadership of her eeoc complaint

while timing alone can establish a prima facie case of retaliation its not always enough to carry a retaliation claim for example one year between a complaint and firing didnt show bias the 5th circuit recently ruled and similarly the 11th circuit said a termination that occurred eight months after filing an eeoc complaint wasnt retaliation ; dolly castro took to instagram yesterday to do what she does best sharing a photo of herself in some tight workout attire the brunette bombshell makes her living by being a fitness trainer and shes never been shy when it comes to showing off her hard work at the gym in plenty of sexy workout clothes in the latest update that was shared for fans castro flaunted her figure at the gym in a brand that she frequently promotes  1st phorm

the nigerian made this known in a paper written in collaboration with german institutions including university of sport cologne university of leipzig vollmann group and werner sportverein bochum

the leading european football countries that african teams are tempted to copy training techniques have acknowledged the need to modernize many of their existing structures and performance technology arosanyin wrote in the paper titled programmes provided for african teams in fifa world cup

for example when i was the fitness trainer for asante kotoko in ghana i noticed during a training tour with the black stars of ghana preparing for the 2010 world cup in south africa the lack in aerobic endurance and high intensity training which is useful to perform short rapid movement and agility sprints for 5 to 15 minutes during a proper game was not addressed he said

arosanyin who is also a sports psychologist stressed the need for a good working relationship between coaches sports doctors and fitness trainers adding that negative working atmosphere can adversely affect the players especially those recovering from injuries

a good working relationship is very essential he explained a general fitness regime must be maintained especially when treating injured players

some coaches due to external and internal pressure would want to rush a player who is injured into playing again and this might lead to a clash between them and the fitness and medical teams

i believe it is better for treatment to take a bit longer to return to full fitness than the risk of getting injured a second time

it is due to poor supervision of treatment training that many footballers get injured almost immediately the recover from their previous injury and these kinds of injuries might make them lose confidence in themselves arosanyin added ; umar and yasir have studied together and are friends so i think whatever umar said was in a lighter mood kamran

veteran pakistan wicketkeeperbatsman kamran akmal has come out in defence of his younger brother umar who is facing a ban for allegedly misbehaving at a fitness test saying he was just joking and didnt intend to offend anyone

outoffavour wicketkeeper umar who has a history of landing himself in controversies apparently made some crude remarks to the trainer yasir when the skinfolding test was being conducted at the national cricket academy

the matter has been reported to the pakistan cricket board pcb and umar now faces the prospect of being banned from the countrys next domestic tournament

umar and yasir have studied together and are friends so i think whatever umar said was in a lighter mood and he didnt have any intention to misbehave with anyone kamran said on the gsports show on gtv news channel

kamran too finds himself in a spot of bother with the pakistan cricket board pcb after he skipped two fitness tests and failed when he finally appeared for the test

the two brothers remain out of favour with the national selectors and a source said that the matter had been brought to the notice of the pcb which was now conducting an inquiry and would take appropriate action

umar could find himself banned from playing in the coming national oneday championship the source said

kamran said they know the importance of maintaining high fitness standards and were working hard on their fitness levels to meet the new required standards set by the pakistan team management

but as usual this incident has been overblown in the media because umar didnt do anything intentionally he was just joking said kamran who last played for pakistan in 2017 in the west indies

but if the pcb feels in its inquiry he has done something wrong they should caution and reprimand him he can also apologize but a ban would be very harsh he said

about his failing the fitness test kamran said he had been playing cricket for the last 20years and had always given his best on the field

even this season i have constantly played in the quaideazam trophy and the national t20 championship without any problems with my match fitness and i have also performed well said the 38yearold

i just think nowadays there is over stress on fitness rather than on improving match skills of players added kamran who has played 53 tests 157 odis and 58 t20 internationals for pakistan

kamran 38 said that the players should be given a chance to prepare for this tests

but i or umar have no issues with trying to meet the new fitness standards the new tests are pretty tough for anyone so i think players must be given a chance to prepare for these tests ; a cheap option with musthave health features like sleep stage detection and workout recording

whether youre reading this because you genuinely love working out or because your air fryer isnt making you feel as healthy as you predicted it would one things for sure a fitness tracker is a necessity for anyone hoping to get fit this year

the rhetoric around fitness has changed quite a bit recently and the selfcare revolution can be thanked for it actively monitoring your fitness progression isnt just for athletes or people training for their local park run its a factor of wellness that people are building into their daily groove just like getting regular massages or keeping up with a skincare routine

its not just the time that youre sweating that matters either restorative exercises are on trend just as much as before and after pictures these can be anything from quick meditation techniques to taking a day for rest or athome yoga between intense days at the gym everyone has their own therapeutic methods but the overall mentality is love yourself just as hard as you push yourself

this type of mindfulness isnt always easy and the best fitness trackers are the ones that will keep you in check throughout your workout as well as the rest of your day most go past casual activity tracking to track your sleep quality heart rate body temperature and even tell you if youve been exercising too hard  all of which can aid in optimal performance and overall health the positive impact that these hightech bracelets and other wearable fitness gadgetry can have on your lifestyle as a whole is pretty incredible

at this point in the game most relatively nice fitness trackers will have a screen and can at least get calls text notifications and music streaming by syncing to your phone even the budgetfriendly models will probably have some sort of healthconscious features past activity tracking like a heart rate sensor

the main tipping point will likely be how much you care about builtin gps or even fancier cellular connectivity most general purpose fitness trackers wont have either of those and youll need to bring your phone with you if you want to use location services and track your mileage accurately smartwatches like the apple watch or samsung galaxy watch active2 are essentially a mini smartphone on your wrist and can map using gps even if your phones at home

there are a whole lot of models out there for you to consider with something for everyone and every budget we have taken stock of everything on the market to bring you a selection of the very best devices including fitness trackers from top brands like apple samsung fitbit and garmin ; former watford coach quique sanchez flores has warned manchester united that odion ighalo will need one month to recover full rhythm

flores worked with the nigerian striker at vicarage road where he netted 39 goals across twoandahalf seasons with 16 of those coming in the premier league

ighalo has signed a sixmonth loan deal with united and arrived in the uk over the weekend from chinese side shanghai shenhua

mainly the problem is how they train in china it is not the same as in england

is he really ready for firstteam matches in the premier league because the physical difference is so big he probably needs one month to recover the full rhythm

the good thing is he knows his body well works hard on injury prevention and he is always working after training

i should say also that i felt in china he gave exactly the same effort and quality as he gave me four years ago we had the feeling in china that he could recover a high level with any team in europe flores told the athletic

flores however believes that ighalo will prove to be a good addition to ole gunnar solskjaers squad

i have an amazing impression of the player i fell in love with him as a guy hes professional hes a straight arrow as a person his life is private he has strong christian values and he is respectful

as a player it is difficult to explain ighalo his first quality is he can protect the ball and he gives time to the team to get up the field and win the second ball its so difficult to get the ball from him hes stronger than he looks

four years ago when we put ball in the space he was also super fast now with five years difference he is a bit different but he will always be fine in a physical battle

we played him up front in a two with troy deeney and they knew each other inside out but he is absolutely fine to play as a lone frontman too one of his most valuable qualities is that his teammates very quickly learn his strengths and he adapts very well he added ; everyone remembers the result but it is also hard to forget what happened in the hours before last years grand final

greater western sydney key defender phil davis  who was the captain on the day  was put through an intense fitness test at the punt road end of the ground in front of the richmond faithful

round 1

but the 29yearold was cleared to play and the rest is history

the man who was the first player to announce he was joining gws struggled to make an impact and the giants got pumped by 89 points  the third biggest grand final margin in aflvfl history

davis has revealed the psychological impact grand final week had on him which was heightened by the question marks of his fitness and the failure on the big stage

it public scrutiny does affect you it still gets in davis told aflcomau

i remember my end of season review i was still emotional five days after because it had been a big week the build up to it and then what happened on the day myself leon mark mcveigh in a room i was upset i didnt fully breakdown but i was clearly emotional and the chat had nothing to do with football

the year was a challenging year an emotional rollercoaster from which we had to recover we spoke about how i had to get my body back and then mentally recharge

in that moment and this is what is hard to get across to people everything is heightened in that grand final everything is heightened after it everything is heightened you add on to that the stresses of everything else i was just exhausted add to that failure and thats what it was  we lost a grand final

plus me dealing with scrutiny than id ever had to deal with in my career i think i handled it ok but it is still hard no matter what your skill set is

davis said the immense failure on the last day of the season took its toll in the aftermath of the loss

everyone tries to get to the last two and as a kid you think about winning the norm smith or kicking the last goal he said

to have your dream linked with people telling you that youve failed that was challenging even after having been around the game for a while

davis will start his 2020 campaign when greater western sydney faces crosstown rivals sydney in blacktown on saturday

the giants will then face the tigers in wagga wagga early next month ahead of a season opener against geelong at giants stadium ; issue of safety standards to be adopted by health and fitness clubs was raised in the national assembly today

presidents day was traditionally known as a celebration of the birth of george washington the first president of the county which is on february 22 this tradition began just a year after his death in 1799

but in modern times the day has evolved into a celebration of all us presidents both from the past as well as the present

heres something you dont see every day  a hobbled yoga enthusiast

those of you who read my column with any frequency are picking their glasses up off the ground  i thought you had little time for yoga nope never said that i simply like to challenge exercisers who have misplaced expectations when selecting exercise options

yoga does what it does  develop control enhance balance and flexibility and quiet the mind generally its not a great fat burner or progressive muscle builder im not talking about the hardcore jock yoga classes specifically designed to make you suffer

many doctors hesitate prescribing weightlifting for patients who need to regain muscle and function the benefits are high but so are the risks too many inexperienced trainers prescribing deadlifts to deconditioned clients

yoga and swimming are safer but generally less effective alternatives this is especially true for people dealing with obesity osteoporosis and sarcopenia muscle wasting who require progressive landbased exercise

the answer merge the progressive overload benefits of strength training with the holistic qualities of yoga with a bit of persistence the fusion of these complementary modalities will make you stronger and fitter in no time

control

most people rush through their weight training routine driving to that 12th rep slow down speedy  its more about the journey

momentum redirects necessary tension away from the intended muscle not only does throwing around weights reduce results but it also compromises safety and inflames joints

think of it this way when you drop to the floor between pushups or rockdropandcatch the weight during bicep curls the eccentric portion of the movement is all but eliminated dont worry about the technical term just know that youve only completed half of the work no one wants to put in all the time with only half the results

to progress in the weight room learn to apply the brakes each rep should take three to sex seconds no jerking rocking or cheating start by ensuring the load is appropriate beginners tend to lift lighter weights which is fine in the beginning but experienced exercisers may likewise want to consider reducing the load or dropping reps you can always increase the weight once youve established control

finally make sure you can stop the movement at any time during each rep and continue without losing control

balance

controlled movement not only works the intended muscle but it also forces you to balance anterior and posterior forces

weve all seen the hunched musclebound weightlifter they move like a bulkedup version of grandma  stooped with internally rotated shoulders dont let the bulging biceps fool you both zeus and grandma are imbalanced its like an unseen force has curled them forward because it has

when back and chest muscles atrophy gravity pulls your spine into flexion and draws your shoulders forward improper weight training can have a similar effect

with daily forwardfacing forces pulling you down proper posterior chain hamstring glutes midback training becomes necessary for good posture if you cant get to the gym try this standing with feet together squeeze your butt  like youre tying to hold a playing card between your cheeks  and tighten your stomach like youre awaiting a punch push your chest toward the sky while feeling tension between your shoulder blades and open your palms to the front hold the pose for five long deep breaths release and repeat throughout the day

this exercise is a great start to progress however you will need to add weight though resistance exercise

quiet the mind

unless youre squeezing out a final rep or two growling and barking for the average weight room user is entirely unnecessary quiet introspection should be the rule you may want to switch gyms if the barking gets out of hand

sure some people enjoy pounding beats spurring them to greatness i prefer something a little less dramatic

like yoga weight training should foster thoughtful mindbody connection focus or close your eyes feel muscles contracting check and recheck core and shoulder stability manage tension and control speed inhale through the nose exhale repeat

once form has been mastered weigh training can be just as calming as yoga loud energetic exercise has its place but dont think its your only option for balance and control try mindful resistance training

yoga resistance fusion

is weight training better than yoga no just different

again its important to select an activity that suits your goals  resistance training for strength and function yoga to calm the soul and promote flexibility

better yet when resistance training combine the principles of both and double your progress

the starting of the olympic year has been good especially because last year we managed to qualify for tokyo since then womens hockeys graph is going well in the last three years the team has done quite well rani told pti

the skipper feels south african wayne patrick lombard who was appointed as the scientific advisor of the womens team in 2017 has made a significant contribution in improving the fitness level of the players something the squad had lacked earlier

the combination of fitness and skill has been great earlier we used to lag behind in fitness but that has improved in the last three years wayne lombard has worked really hard with the team personally and individually she said

gov gavin newsom has proposed halting physical fitness tests in california schools to study whether they encourage bullying and discrimination

under the proposal schools would drop physical fitness tests until at least 2024 to study whether the test promotes body shaming or gender identity discrimination hd palmer spokesman for the california department of finance said the state has received complaints that the tests measurement of body mass index bmi is discriminatory to gender nonbinary students

newsom wants california to be first state to sell its own prescription drugs

the test is currently administered to students in fifth seventh and ninth grades bmi screenings calculated using height and weight require students to select male or female

during the suspension the california department of education would consult with experts in fitness adaptive physical education gender identity and students with disabilities regarding the purpose and administration of the physical performance test according to the proposal which was released quietly inside the education budget bill for next year

given the body of research on the impacts of bullying on transgender and special education students during this period of suspension its important to take this pause and determine whether the current test can be modified or whether a new assessment should be developed palmer said on monday according to politico

mike rowe responds to oped calling on him to run for governor its flattering

physical fitness tests have been encouraged by the federal government for decades and california public schools have required the test since 1996

in 2012 thenpresident barack obama tweaked the test to focus more on student health rather than athleticism including running assessments pushups curlups and sit and reach stretches

about 60 percent of last years tested students in california fell in the healthy fitness zone according to the latest california department of education data ; gov gavin newsom wants to pause physical education tests for california students for three years due to concerns over bullying and possible discrimination against disabled and nonbinary students

the move comes after annual test results showed a growing percentage of students scoring as not healthy

hd palmer spokesman for the department of finance said the state has received complaints that the current examinations measurement of body mass index is discriminatory to nonbinary students a measurement calculated from weight and height the school bmi screenings require students to select male or female he said

annual state reports of the fitness test since the 201415 school year show a steady decline in the share of students scoring healthy according to a review by the associated press students scores have particularly dropped in the category of the test that measures aerobic capacity which can be tested with a onemile run for example other categories test for flexibility and exercises like pushups

in the last five years the percentage of fifth graders scoring healthy in the aerobic category has dropped by 33 percentage points in seventh and ninth grades the drops are 44 percentage points and 38 percentage points respectively meanwhile the percentage of students identified as needing improvement and having a health risk went up by 33 percentage points among fifth graders 44 for seventh graders and 38 among ninth graders

the department of education did not immediately comment on those results

during the suspension of the physical fitness test program that newsom has proposed the state would study whether the current test should be modified or redrawn anew palmer said

physical education classes would remain a requirement for graduation however

the proposal first reported by politico was tucked inside newsoms education budget bill for next year

school districts nationwide use such tests and the results can inform stillgrowing children about potential health problems experts say but data from such tests and bmi measurements should not be used to diagnose health risks according to the society of health and physical educators

the issue of bmi screening plays a role in the issues of both body shaming and bullying palmer also wrote in an email

bodybuilder and former california gov arnold schwarzenegger had several school fitness initiatives during his time in office he said through a spokesman that physical education classes should be the top priority

whether the state uses fitness tests or not gov schwarzenegger believes that the most important thing is that our students have access to daily physical education classes to promote a healthy and fit lifestyle said daniel ketchell a spokesman for schwarzenegger

ketchell agreed that bmi screenings are flawed he said for instance that the 6foot2inch 240pound schwarzenegger would have been officially classified as obese when he won the top bodybuilding title of mr olympia in 1974 ; whether youre training for your very first marathon or youve been around the block a few times having a reliable fitness tracker can make a huge difference in your experience fortunately there are many great products to choose from these days weve gathered some of the best ones you can buy as a marathon runner

babies with low weight at birth may grow up to have bodies with weaker ability to supply oxygen to the muscles according to a study which emphasises the importance of strategies to reduce low birth weight in infants

according to researchers including those from karolinska institute in sweden having a good cardiorespiratory fitness is important for staying healthy and can reduce the risk of numerous diseases and premature death

however they said this ability of the body to supply oxygen to muscles during exercise is declining globally both for youths and adults the current study published in the journal of the american heart association assessed if low birth weights played a role for cardiorespiratory fitness in individuals born after pregnancy of 3741 weeks

in the study the scientists followed more than 280000 males from birth to military conscription at age 1724 using swedish populationbased registers they found that those born with higher birth weights performed significantly better in a fitness test on a cycle ergometer  a stationary bicycle equipped with an instrument to measure the amount of work done by the individual peddling the bike

according to the study for every 450 grams of extra weight at birth in a baby born at 40 weeks the maximum work capacity on the bicycle increased by an average of 79 watts the scientists added that the association was stable across all categories of weights of individuals in young adulthood and was largely similar in a subset analysis of more than 52000 siblings

based on these findings the researchers said current weight and shared genetic and environmental factors alone cannot explain the link between birth weight and cardiorespiratory fitness the observed 79 watts increase for each 450 grams of extra weight at birth in a baby born at 40 weeks translates into approximately 134 increase in metabolic equivalent met which has been associated with a 13 per cent difference in the risk of premature death and a 15 per cent difference in the risk of developing cardiovascular disease said daniel berglind study coauthor from karolinska institutet

such differences in mortality are similar to the effect of a 7centimeter reduction in waist circumference berglind added according to the researchers the findings are of significance to public health since about 15 per cent of babies born globally weigh less than 25 kilogrammes at birth

providing adequate prenatal care may be an effective means of improving adult health not only through prevention of established harms associated with low birth weight but also via improved cardiorespiratory fitness said study coauthor viktor h ahlqvist from karolinska institute ; chris withington faces a race against the clock to be fit for the next step on worcester citys wembley trail

having secured the data of what people eat and like to have together through its virtual assistant ria launched in 2017 the founder said the startup wanted to not only impart advice but also fulfill diet needs through partnerships with food delivery app swiggy and grocery delivery app milkbasket

currently in pilot stage users can avail a selection of healthy diet plans and restaurants powered by healthifyme on swiggy under fitpicks it is also exploring options to launch cobranded subscription plans for healthy meals in gurugram through swiggy daily

tushar said ignite is a day when the startup reimagines the future and tries to stretch the limits of technology ; since jan 2 the usual crowd of those looking to shed their holiday pounds and those eager for a new healthy start for 2020 have crowded new jersey gyms they flock to fitness classes swimming lanes treadmills stationary bikes and weight rooms and line up to meet with personal trainers

if its been awhile since you took that daunting first step into your local gym you might find it looks different from what you remember when you were decked out in your scrunchie and sweat bands back in the day

from gyms that are smarter than your average iphone to small group classes which bring fun to fitness to fitness resorts that offer work play dining and living in a onestopshop  heres whats trending in the fitness world throughout the garden state

rockaway resident andrew polizzotto frequently can be found at his local retro fitness taking a spin class running on the treadmill or lifting in the weight room

but since he began working out five years ago and met a multitude of fitness junkies hes seen a lot of people quit lowcost gyms and instead swap their cheap memberships for sciencebased gyms which come with big promises

many people who dont know how to work out sign up for these big gyms and end up quitting and it becomes a huge hassle to cancel your 10 membership he said instead it seems like more people are joining sciencebased gyms such as orangetheory which determine the best individualized workout for you to get you to the desired heart rate zone

the exercise coach is one such sciencebased gym or smart gym smart gyms have been exploding in popularity with 70 us studios and 50 more slated to open in the united states this year in new jersey the intimate 1200squarefoot studios can be found in brielle cherry hill midland park fair haven and florham park

with the exercise coach clients start out by initially doing a strength test a computer then prescribes each client a personalized program which is adjusted as needed by a trainer to create a routine optimized for efficiency each program includes strength building and high intensity cardio that only needs to be done for 20 minutes two days per week to see results

people who want good results like someone who is in the gym all of the time can achieve that with this program said richard edelstein coowner of the midland park exercise coach location which opened jan 7 there are a lot of people who are too busy and they dont have time for traditional fitness programs and theyre also afraid of getting injured

at lifetime which has fitness centers in bridgewater princeton mount laurel berkeley heights florham park and montvale tech also has a place in the gym thanks to their volt app which offers individualized virtual training

if a member seeks to supplement their usual workout and are unable to do oneonone training they can log into the app and a trainer will input a suggested workout based on their usual exercise habits with instructions on how to increase or decrease the intensity

its a sciencebased result of an active metabolic assessment that tells you how to work out to see the results you want to see said ashley sikora general manager of lifetime bridgewater

when polizzotto began his 80pound weightloss journey five years ago he frequently took spin classes  often as one of the few men in the highintensity cycling classes

as the years have gone on though both the estrogen and testosterone in the room has gone up  a trend polizzotto attributes to both the interest in the peloton bike an athome stationary bike which offers live virtual spin classes with a price tag starting at 2245 as well as the growing popularity of small group classes

i think people are interested in the peloton after seeing the commercials but they dont want to spend the money on the peloton itself said polizzotto plus i think small group classes are good for people who dont know what they want to do at the gym and also want the motivation that a personal trainer would give along with the camaraderie of other people

at lifetime bridgewater sikora said she also has seen the popularity of small group classes skyrocket with offerings including pilates barre gtx and alpha at the gyms seven studios

classes such as yoga and cycling inspire community and are entertaining and fun versus doing a workout and just leaving since many members will get together after the class to talk or go to the café she said anything that builds camaraderie and accountability is very popular here

although small group classes are not offered at the exercise coach accountability is also the name of the game since the personalized sessions are appointmentbased plus they offer minutebyminute instruction that open gyms lack

you would be surprised how many people dont know what to do once theyre in the gym but in our program someone shows you every step of the way said edelstein

these days many gyms are offering more than just classes  or even fitness instead opting to become onestopshops for their clients as they seek to attract more members especially those living in urban areas who do not have cars

contact jintersimonegannettcom or jintersimone ; throughout history parents have fought to get their children an education because they want them to grow into successful functional adults while in school a child will learn how to write how to solve equations and in a perfect world how to live a healthy and active life unfortunately californias public education systems past attempts to provide that health education have been shaky at best

california governor gavin newsom seems to agree in fact he has gone so far as to propose a three year suspension on all physical fitness testing newsoms reasoning behind this halt is undeniably solid he fears that current mandatory physical fitness testing which includes a body mass index bmi screening that only considers male or female options is discriminatory against nonbinary individuals furthermore he argues that the tests are inherently biased against students with disabilities and that the public nature of the testing promotes the bullying of children who may not perform as well as their peers

gov newsoms reasoning is nuanced and reasonable the three year halt he proposed is meant to give the california department of education time to revise the tests so they can be better implemented in the futurethis is where newsoms proposal falls short fitness testing for grade school and middle school children is fundamentally flawed from the very beginning ideally fitness testing would not only be stopped permanently but the way physical education pe classes are run would be revised entirely

when a student takes any other exam the test results are private and the students peers will never know their results unless said student chooses to share them conversely the fitness tests taken during a students pe period are most often performed in groups of other students a student struggling with the fitnessgram pacer test for instance has no way of hiding their results their peers will know how well the student performed whether the student likes it or not this can lead to bullying and in turn discourage the student from participating in physical activity later on

at the end of the day if a student has an alarming health concern the conversation should take place behind closed doors with the childs parents and the school nurse the other children in the school yard have only one use for such information  it makes for good ammunition when picking on others

compounding that many components of the tests fail to provide an accurate estimate of a students overall health and wellbeing a students ability to perform a perfect pushup or touch their hands together behind their back is not a particularly useful measure of how healthy the student is currently nor is it an accurate predictor of how healthy they will be in the future

moreover as gov newsom noted the use of bmi in testing is fundamentally flawed according to the current formula people with a bmi between 185 and 25 are of a normal weight those between 25 and 30 are overweight and those with a bmi over 30 are obese

most embarrassingly the formula which takes an individuals weight and divides it by their height squared is incredibly short sighted this formula results in ones weight being divided by too much in shorter children and by too little in taller children which leads to taller children being told they are more overweight than they actually are and shorter children being told they are thinner than is the case a formula so flawed should have no place in informing a child of their fitness levels

still many worry about the health of their children and reasonably so these fitness tests have been in use for decades now and parents who are concerned with their childs development are inclined to defer to them many claim that the tests are conducted in the interest of making sure children stay active and fit they give children a tangible reason to strive to improve like the proverbial sword of damocles the fitness test hangs high above their heads swinging ever so slightly lower as the year goes on until the test is finally upon them if the child wants to do well they need to get in shape

of course this is all well and good until one considers the fact that these tests tend to have just the opposite effectthere is little evidence to suggest that these tests promote healthy behaviors in actuality the tests are more likely to harm a students desire to be active than encourage physical growth forced public fitness testing can be uncomfortable and embarrassing for some children leading them to dread the inevitable test date poor test scores which can be inaccurate and misleading also serve to demotivate children to do better in the future instead teaching children that they are doomed to an unhealthy and unhappy future

these issues dont end when the last student completes their final sit up and its time to go back inside for math the potential for bullying and prevalence of discouragement are woven into the way gym class is run as a whole suggesting that the entire pe system is flawed and requires revision if there is any hope of providing children with proper physical education

it is a secret to no one that children will fight tooth and nail to avoid activities they dont want to participate in if the goal is to encourage kids to be healthy fitness must be made fun unfortunately gym class can all too often be just the opposite in most districts pe is supervised by coaches whose passions lay in the actual sport not education

the severe judgemental comments coaches are prone to making may be appropriate in certain settings  say when a sports team is training to take on a rival school  but mean spirited comments from old men in tight shorts are rarely encouraging to the average child especially if the child doesnt have a natural interest in physical activity highly trained physical education teachers should instead fill these roles and coaches should not be forced to teach if that isnt their primary interest they should be allowed to do what they do best coach sports

to ensure students are showing up for class pe should remain mandatory but it should be taken pass or fail a childs gpa should not be contingent on how quickly they can run a mile furthermore if funding permits students would ideally have a choice between different forms of exercise forcing a child who hates playing football to play football will only cement the idea that sports and by extension physical activity is painful and boring in their minds

not every kid is born eager to go out and shoot hoops but physical fitness can be encouraged to do so the school system must meet the children where they stand physical fitness tests serve as the first major obstacle it may take a while to implement these changes but gov newsom is trying to push california in the right direction with proper revision to pe standards californian students may see better health outcomes soon ; continuing his goal of ending childhood obesity fitness icon jake steinfeld chairman of the national foundation for governors fitness councils nfgfc has kicked off 2020 by selecting the state of alabama for its 2020 dont quit campaign the nfgfc will deliver a stateoftheart dont quit fitness center to three elementary or middle schools school nominations will be accepted starting monday february 3 until friday march 20 download your states nomination form here httpnatgovfitorgnominateyourschool and fill out the short application its as easy as 1 2 3 nominate your school today

while oftentimes we have the will to stay fit many of us grow weary of monotonous sessions on the elliptical machine jogging for miles or getting nowhere on a treadmill it may be time for a challenge that will engage your body and your mind

indoor climbing is gathering quite the following and not just within the climbing community for most it is a sport they know little about few have considered it as an option for a real workout however once you try it you may be hooked for life

indoor climbing is one of the fastest growing sports in north america and its garnering attention and praise from fitness and medical experts alike and for good reason evidence suggests the sport challenges every muscle group in the body in addition to being a superb stressbuster and overall brainbooster that can help improve cognitive function and serve as a valuable adjunct in the treatment of conditions like autism and depression

peak fitness

impressed but not persuaded that indoor climbing can give you the same cardiooomph your morning jog does consider this  studies indicate ascending a rock wall can get your heart pumping as effectively as climbing stairs or jogging

in fact a onehour climbing session can burn well over 700 calories  much more than the 560 calories youd burn spending the same amount of time running at a sixmileperhour pace whats more climbing utilizes almost every muscle group in the body not just your arms

max considine program coordinator for saanichs the boulders climbing gym explains youre like a monkey when youre climbing you use your whole body legs and core to propel yourself up the wall climbing improves the strength endurance speed and flexibility in most major muscle groups and not many sports do that

that fullbody workout translates into a pretty attractive aesthetic proponents of the sport claim regular climbing can leave you with strong toned shoulders lean thighs strengthened arms back and neck and a rocksolid core in addition the long reaches and intricate footwork needed to scale a wall can develop flexibility and balance and leave you as limber as yes a monkey

in addition to helping you achieve peak fitness climbing can enhance your mental health according to research from indiana university climbers who totally lose themselves in the flow of the sport enter a mindset that can create euphoria and even block physical pain

theres even more good news for your brain some small studies have shown that indoor climbing can have positive effects on anxiety depression and adhd

as more and more people get into the sport doctors and physiotherapists alike are heralding the positive benefits of rock climbing it has also been proven as a therapeutic approach to treat depression in austria where the sport is heralded as an activity that promotes mindfulness selfawareness selfefficacy and trust there is even an institute for therapeutic rock climbing

max considine isnt surprised climbing in general requires a high degree of concentration focus and perseverance it really builds confidence puts you in a zen sort of state and improves overall cognitive function

he adds ive seen painfully shy children lacking in selfesteem blossom into selfconfident outgoing kids within a month of taking up indoor climbing its wonderful to see that kind of development

getting social

another salient element in indoor climbings trifecta of health perks is its inherent social aspect

climbers are a supportive bunch spend time at any climbing facility and youll see people swapping tricks and tips with individuals theyve never met before or several people climbing on a section of wall working out the route together youll also likely see folks whove completed a route gathered on the ground cheering on others who are still propelling up the wall

why is all this important a plethora of studies confirm that socializing is good for us and heals us through the same basic physical mechanisms as diet and exercise people with good social connections have stress hormone blood profiles that are significantly healthier than folks who are isolated they also have more circulating immune cells and lower cardiac inflammatory protein

there are two ways to get started in indoor climbing you can join a just hang session under the guidance and supervision of skilled staff members these sessions include all technical equipment and staff belayers to look after all the rope management aspects theres also bouldering where people climb without ropes over safety mats at heights of up to four or five metres its a great way to experience climbing without the need for equipment

indoor rock climbing is a great way for friends and corporate groups to partake in something fun the boulders climbing gym offers both options and also rents at a nominal fee any equipment you may require all you need to do is show up and begin your own ascent towards peak physical and mental health there are also several classes you can sign up for as a beginner or to improve your technique they are open 3 pm to 10 pm monday to friday and 10 am to 6 pm saturday and sunday

boulders also welcomes families with only a few restrictions children must be at least six years old with a parentguardian or 14 years old without a guardian

alia does a lot of pilates with me but since the last six months she has been very busy with all the different movies that shes been shooting for she used to be very regular but now we do pilates whenever she gets time  i believe each persons body is unique to themselves and each body type is very different from the other what i always tell my clients is look at the body you have and try to make it the best that you can get look at others for motivation but its not like a person who is 52 can look like deepika padukone her body is longer her muscles are longer her limbs are longer you can look better in your own body each of us needs to accept our body and work on making that the best she advises the youth ; fitness model ashleigh jordan shared a dose of fitspiration with her 3 million instagram followers on wednesday when she uploaded a video series in which she trained her glutes

dressed in a purple sports bra and leggings the blond beauty started the workout with a set of singleleg lying abductions with a cable machine in her caption she recommended doing three sets of 20 reps then she moved on to a doing gliding side lunges with a barbell hoisted on her shoulders for this exercise she also suggested three 20rep sets the third video saw her knock out a set of curtsy lunges with side leg raises which she did while holding a weight plate

then she moved on to extended clamshells which meant that she had to lie on her side with each rep she raised her torso and hips upward and spread her knees propping up her body on her elbow as she did so in her caption she recommended doing three sets of 15 reps on each side

in her last video she shared a fit tip of the day in which she shared advice on how the exercises could be done at home

all of these exercises can be done with bodyweight or using a resistance band she said in the clip a lot of those exercises that you see at the gym can be easily altered so you can do them at home

a post shared by αѕнℓєιgн ashleigh_jordan on feb 19 2020 at 504pm pst ; new york wcbs   one fitness studio is giving hot workouts the cold shoulder putting into practice that exercising in frigid temperatures could actually burn more calories

princess sutherland is not a coldweather person but despite that shes trying something new a workout class where the thermostat is set to a chilly 50 degrees reports cbs2s michael george

it was out of my comfort zone i said let me try that she said

the class is called brrrn  with an emphasis on the brrr  offering high intensity in low temperatures

the theory is that working out in the cold is more refreshing and can help you burn more calories says cofounder jimmy t martin

our whole thesis is that we want you to sustain a higher intensity for a longer period of time and cooler temperatures do that for you he said

instructors say the frigid temperatures also trigger the bodys metabolism to keep you warm

if you dont have a class like this in your neighborhood there are still some ways you can get all the benefits of a coldweather workout

you can go for what we call a shiver walk so like dress with light layers go for a walk around your block do some calisthenics said martin

after her first try princess says shes convinced

it was just high intensity from the start she said it felt better breathing in there and it just feels refreshed when you stopped working out

experts say exercising outside in cooler weather can also boost your mood and immunity during cold and flu season ; global mobile health and fitness sensors market report 20202025 provides insightful data about business strategies qualitative and quantitative analysis of global market the report also calls for market  driven results deriving feasibility studies for client needs marketinsightsreports ensures qualified and verifiable aspects of market data operating in the real time scenario the analytical studies are conducted ensuring client needs with a thorough understanding of market capacities in the real time scenario

irfan tamboli head of sales  market insights reports ; highrisk situations and rigid rules for healthy behaviors increase the risk of relapse

jesse had been attending the evening body sculpting class for 5 years and loved how great she felt she knew everyone in the class and even though she was the only person who had been in the class from the beginning she welcomed each new member but new members had been few and far between for the past year jesse liked this though because she almost felt as if she were getting personal training as the class got smaller when the fitness director told her that they were discontinuing this evening class in 2 weeks jesse was shocked and discombobulated she felt like the rug had been pulled out from under her she glanced at the sheet with the new schedule of group exercise classes and left it in the locker room now what am i going to do she moaned

jesse needed a plan b for her exercise routine setting up a regular routine and making fitness activities habits can foster longterm adherence but dependency on a particular routine puts a client at risk of not doing anything if the routine is disrupted without access to her accustomed class jesse was at risk of not exercising at all and relapsing into a more sedentary lifestyle

the challenges of adherence to a healthy lifestyle are addressed in the relapse prevention model which focuses on identifying situations that increase the chance someone will return to an old undesired behavior pattern and on implementing strategies to cope effectively with these highrisk situations  although the model addresses the maintenance of voluntary selfcontrol and the cyclical nature of longterm behavior change marlatt and gordon  aimed to explain how to enhance the abstinence from a highfrequency undesired behavior in the context of the persons ability to cope with relapses cognitively and behaviorally the strategies associated with relapse prevention have been applied to maintaining positive health behaviors such as sticking with a strength training program and eating at least five servings of vegetables each day there will be a separate column on relapse prevention in general but here the focus is on how having a plan b for workouts in the short and longer term is an important skill for your clients to decrease the risk of dropping out when their routine is disrupted

we want clients to make exercise and healthy eating habits because once a habit is established the behavior is activated based on situational cues and becomes more automatic and less dependent on reasoned consideration  automatic behavior can thus reduce the cognitive demands of participating in healthy behaviors we just dont have to think much about how and when well get in our workout or how to prepare a healthy meal in jesses case she didnt have to decide what to do after work on tuesdays and thursdays or what to do once she arrived at the fitness center to get the workout she wanted she had a familiar consistent predictable routine  until she learned that her class would be canceled

everyone has to manage predictable disruptions in their lives events such as vacations and family holidays are typical situations that put regular exercisers at risk of skipping their usual activities and dietary choices many events that cause disruptions in a routine can be anticipated and thus provide opportunities to plan ahead and make healthy adjustments such as skipping a morning jog before a family barbeque but taking a long walk with family members after the meal the fitness professional can be aware of shared and personal situations that will make it harder for clients to stick with a fitness plan and work with them to make adjustments sharing a map of safe walking routes in the community and healthy holiday recipes before winter break offering a class on body resistance routines that can be done on vacation and organizing a walking club for parents waiting for their children during soccer practice are examples of ways to help clients plan ahead and have options for maintaining healthy habits

accommodating minor transient variations in an exercise routine pose little problem for most people swimming on tuesday instead of wednesday skipping the leg press to pick up a child from the sitter on time and walking an extra block to check out the new shop in the neighborhood are examples of minor adjustments individuals make without feeling that their personal exercise program is off track but having a fitness program that is place time or mode dependent puts clients at risk of lapsing or relapsing from regular exercise even if the disruption is temporary their automatic pilot is not useful and they have to make multiple decisions about what when where and how they are going to respond for someone like jesse exercise options had not been considered for a while because she assumed that her workout place and mode were stable and her plan for meeting her exercise goals was fixed

having limitations or more rigid rules for meeting a target behavior eg i only exercise after work will increase the chances that deviations from that routine will lead to relapse

although jesse had a strong exercise habit it was limited to a specific place time and mode fostering skills to cope with disruptions that are minor jogger has 45 minutes to exercise and all the treadmills are in use menu has no vegetarian entrées or major favorite longterm pilates instructor is moving out of state freezer full of frozen meals spoiled when electricity went out can help your clients increase their selfefficacy for overcoming barriers and maintain their healthy choices remind them that flexibility and options in a plan are important for longterm maintenance plan b for volume of activity can be included in flexible goals such as working out 3 to 5 days a week or walking at least 10000 steps a day the lower range of these goals can be used when time is more limited or other barriers arise having place options such as running on the treadmill in the gym instead of outside during inclement weather or participating in online guided yoga routines when at home with a sick child can be manageable options when clients cant exercise where they want to helping clients with mode options is important for several reasons although swimmers might be frustrated when the pool is closed for maintenance having a variety of aerobic strength and flexibility options that are part of their fitness plan b will keep them active when they cant participate in their preferred mode flexibility in exercise mode also comes in handy in coping with an injury a fractured wrist for example would not mean that a client stops strength training until the cast is off if he or she has backup plans in place and guidance in safe alternative fitness activities in addition different exercise modes are part of a balanced fitness program that meets acsm guidelines

major permanent disruptions in fitness programs are going to happen but fitness professionals can make sure their clients have appealing alternatives and not experience jesses distress and risk of dropping out when her class was canceled promoting different programs and new equipment to new and established clients such as try me classes and refresher instruction on using gym equipment will increase client awareness of options and make it easier to shift to appealing substitutions when necessary disruptions can be predictable or unexpected but they dont have to derail healthy behaviors if your clients have engaging plan bs in their toolkits ; calling all fitness professionals what motivational cues are best functionfocused or appearancefocused

group exercise continues to be popular in the united states and around the world most fitness instructors provide liberal and continuous motivational cues throughout their classes in an effort to increase positivity encouragement and participant satisfaction but what types of motivational cues are most effective in terms of participant mood body satisfaction and overall improvement in a 2018 study researchers engeln shavlik and daly aimed to find out 

in their study 203 collegeaged women were randomly assigned to one of two trials both trials consisted of a 16minute strength and conditioning group fitness class exercises and basic exercise informational and alignment cues were the same for both trials exercises included squats pushups quadrupeds abdominal crunches bicycle crunches and planks

in one trial the instructor used functionfocused motivational comments such as youll strengthen your core muscles enabling your body to do all the amazing things you enjoy or squats are crucial for developing strength in the legs helping you to run jump and sprint like a super hero or this exercise will help you prevent injuries and build strength or this is a powerful move for powerful women

in the other trial the instructor used appearancefocused motivational comments such as this exercise will help you lose those last few pounds getting your bikini body ready for summer or this exercise blasts fat in the legs  no more thunder thighs for us get rid of that cellulite or earn your dream body or pushups target your chest and those awkward bat wings poking out of your strapless dresses or blast that muffin top target your pooch target that cottage cheese

results showed that the women in the functionfocused conditioning group had significantly greater increases in body satisfaction and positive affect good mood than women in the appearancefocused conditioning group the study also measured participants tendencies to monitor their bodys appearance body surveillance which can be a marker of selfobjectification objectification theory  proposes that cultural factors such as a constant focus on female appearance via the media can negatively affect womens body image this can cause women to internalize cultural messages about how they should look and constantly view themselves from an outside perspective as in am i prettythinyoung enough is my body as desirable as substitute name of celebritymodelfriends body selfobjectification and body surveillance have been associated with several negative outcomes in women such as body shame dissatisfaction and eating disorders not coincidentally selfobjectification also has been linked with poor exercise quality and adherence

the takehome message for those of us in the health and fitness industry is this the language we use when motivating people has power contrary to the messages found on many supermarket tabloids and fitness magazines bodyshaming language can actually decrease womens motivation to exercise instead we want to emphasize the power of movement to promote strength health and wellbeing and avoid mentioning weight loss bodily flaws or appearance we want to focus not on how the body looks but on what it can do and on how great it can feel

would you use a shared treadmill workstation for 2 hours per day if one were available at your workplace what about your friends or family members if so how might this affect your productivity at work and would there be any improvement in health outcomes such as blood pressure or weight loss

in a 2016 study researchers bouchard et al  aimed to explore the answers to these questions and more interest in reducing sedentary behavior is high as studies have shown that the more hours a person spends sitting the greater the risk of death and disease from all causes  in the united states 80 of people have sedentary jobs and there appears to be a correlation between physical inactivity at work and physical inactivity when not at work resulting in poor health outcomes overall sitting for long periods can result in lowerback pain other musculoskeletal issues decreased glucose tolerance leading to increased risk of type 2 diabetes decreased highdensity lipoprotein cholesterol increased weight gain and other negative health problems

the bouchard et al pilot study was initiated with 22 office workers average age 51 years four treadmill workstations were provided with a goal of sharing and coordinating 2hour time blocks per shift for each participant for a period of 3 months pre and postmeasurements included overall daily physical activity levels low moderate and vigorous sleep quantity and quality dietary intake and macronutrient proportion resting heart rate and blood pressure weight and height steps per treadmill workstation time estimated energy expenditures in kilocalories per day fatigue and pain levels and participant interest expectations and intentions to use the treadmill workstation

nine people did not complete the evaluation at the end of the 3 months this kind of attrition is relatively normal in most longterm intervention studies however for the 13 individuals who completed the study there were several positive results low intensitysedentary time was reduced by 201 and both systolic and diastolic blood pressures were significantly reduced most of the participants who were considered to be poor sleepers significantly improved their quantity and quality of sleep daily caloric intake was reduced by 185 and body mass index decreased slightly  however these findings were not considered statistically significant perhaps due to the 3 month time span which may not be long enough to result in significant changes

participants walked at an average speed of 19 mph and an average elevation of 103 the number of minutes spent on the treadmill workstation during a single bout ranged from 806 during the first month to 561 during the third month

participants responded favorably to questionnaire items regarding positive experience ease of treadmill workstation use increased physical activity outside of work and increased or same levels of productivity a majority of participants reported that the time spent on the treadmill workstation did not cause undue fatigue and participants were 70 confident that they would keep using the treadmill workstations in the future from this small pilot study the authors concluded that shared treadmill workstations although costly are likely to be acceptable and feasible for many sedentary office workers and can result in important health benefits which may help keep health insurance costs down

in a systematic review of 17 yoga studies  researcher e larsonmeyer aimed to evaluate the energy cost and intensity of yoga postures and breathing exercises hatha yoga the physical practice of yoga postures or asanas has become increasingly popular and is offered in a majority of us health clubs numerous styles of yoga exist most incorporate pranayama techniques breathing exercises and some meditation into an hourlong session power yoga and yoga flow styles also usually include sun salutations surya namaskar which are sequences of 12 asanas that are generally performed over and over leading to an increase in heat breathing frequency and heart rate over time how do these practices fit within acsms physical activity guidelines

the 17 studies included in the systematic review included evaluations of several yoga styles including ashtanga hatha and bikram hot yoga sessions in some of the studies practitioners jumped from one posture to the next during the class in others practitioners rested in savasana supine corpse pose between the postures some studies evaluated standing posture flows while others evaluated seated posture sequences therefore there was a large range of metabolic equivalent met values from 183 to 74 mets with an average of 33 mets across the studies acsm considers activities less than 3 mets to be low intensity according to larsonmeyer the majority of most asanas and full yoga sessions in the systematic review were indeed low or light intensity in nature however those that included multiple sun salutations performed rapidly andor with jumping between the postures met the criteria for moderate to vigorousintensity activity especially when performed by experienced practitioners eight studies in the review measured the metabolic cost of specific individual asanas most of which yielded met values of 3 or less standing postures generally had slightly higher met values than seated postures and backbending poses elicited higher met values than forwardbending poses it was noted that the energy cost of a yoga session can be altered by the use of sequences such as the sun salutation by the choice of higher intensity postures such as standing balance poses andor by incorporating jumping and springingtype moves during the transitions between the postures

pranayama breathing exercise expenditures were evaluated in five of the studies it was found that the average met value during most of the pranayama practices was only 13 although some of the more vigorous breathing techniques yielded met values of 15

although this review specifically evaluated the energy cost of yoga practices and postures it should be noted that in multiple other studies yoga has been shown to result in a large number of health benefits such as decreased depression and anxiety decreased low back pain and improved flexibility and balance ; fitness dance class set to the rhythm of bollywood music 78 pm feb 20 levy park 3801 eastside levyparkhoustonorg

dont set yourself up for disappointment by looking at homes above your budget unless you plan to pay for your house in cash which isnt the norm look at how much you have for a down payment as well as what you can spend on your monthly mortgage consider the costs for monthly nonhouse related expenses so you can live a similar lifestyle after the home purchase while a lender will tell you the maximum financing youre approved for this can often be an amount that would make you uncomfortable on a monthly basis its also good to know your credit score as this heavily impacts your loan

you will have to make compromises and thats alright make a list of the musthaves for your house  include things like neighborhood schools commute and nearby entertainment  so you know what the true deal breakers are now begin looking at available houses in the desired areas to understand the costs its helpful to discuss if youre willing to do work as these houses will cost less or if you want a home you can move into tomorrow

banks and lenders may all offer different mortgage offerings and interest rates do your homework to understand your options by talking with various financial institutions your local community bank is an ideal resource for this type of education and guidance alternately if you have a lender you know you want to use have this person walk you through your options this is also a good time to organize your financing documents  pay stubs past years w2s bank statements list of assets and debts etc  as youll need these for the loan approval and dont want to find yourself in a pinch if youre missing necessary paperwork

this is important for several reasons first desirable homes in hot areas will sell quickly and many realtors wont take clients to view homes without a loan preapproval when you find a house you love this preapproval allows you to act quickly and makes you more desirable than someone without preapproval also this number will set your maximum budget but remember this may be more than youre comfortable spending

there are often real estate agents who specialize in certain areas or know about houses before they officially hit the market ask friends or your lender for recommendations and go with the person who feels right

youve found the perfect first house now what your realtor will help you put together the strongest offer and hopefully it will be accepted if you know there will be numerous offers you will rely on your agents expertise to help set your offer above the rest your realtor is going to teach you about neighborhood comps the option period the home inspection and much more

a home that looks perfect might not be in such great condition behind the walls and under the floors so a home inspection is a must for your protection it will make you aware of what might be hiding before you finalize the sale if the home inspector finds a major problem and you still want the house this enables you to negotiate the cost of the repair with the seller overall youll be much more confident in your purchase after the inspection

youre almost there but it seems like youre signing your life away at the closing your realtor lender and title agency representative will be happy to walk you through the details of each form you sign so dont be afraid to ask congratulations  youre now a homeowner

swedish researchers report that very fit longdistance skiers were about 30 less likely to develop parkinsons disease during their 20year study

the research suggests that any activity that keeps you fit might buffer the brain against disease

our study highlights the importance of staying physically active throughout life in order to have a reserve to better cope when the frailties and diseases of old age inevitably arrive said study senior author tomas deierborg hes an associate professor in neuroscience at lund university in sweden

deierborg said the researchers believe these very fit athletes have built up a greater motor reserve that slows any brain damage from parkinsons disease he said its similar to the idea of cognitive reserve in people with dementia that suggests someone who is welleducated can sustain more brain damage from dementia before symptoms of the disorder become obvious

however not everyone is convinced that motor reserve is playing a role in this studys findings

dr michael okun national medical director for the parkinsons foundation said theres definite agreement among experts that exercise has positive effects on parkinsons disease and many positive effects beyond parkinsons disease but its wishful thinking for us to assume that longdistance skiers have some sort of motor reserve theres just not a lot of data yet

parkinsons disease is a neurodegenerative disorder that often develops slowly over years the exact cause is still unknown according to the parkinsons foundation

the disease may progress differently from one person to the next symptoms often include tremors often at rest other symptoms include slow movements rigid limbs and gait problems

the study followed the health of nearly 200000 longdistance skiers for more than two decades and compared them to a control group from the general population in sweden

the skiers were an average of 36 years old slightly less than twothirds were male all had participated in the vasaloppet long distance crosscountry ski race the race is 90 kilometers about 56 miles long

deierborg said the skiers are very fit as they just participated in one of the longest crosscountry ski races in the world he said most of them skied for at least four hours a week and in general they had higher leisuretime physical activity than the average person in the swedish population they also tended to have better diets

in addition the rate of smoking was far less in the skiers only about 1 smoked compared to around 15 of the general population deierborg noted

compared to the general population the vasaloppet skiers appeared to have a 29 lower risk of developing parkinsons disease over 15 years of followup however the difference in parkinsons cases weakened

deierborg said he doesnt think these benefits are limited to these welltrained skiers any kind of activity would likely reduce the risk of parkinsons he said

on that point okun agreed exercise is good for parkinsons disease you dont need to be an olympiclevel athlete

okun said people with parkinsons disease should participate in a level of activity that works for them

liverpool face an anxious wait to discover if captain jordan henderson will miss a key period of their season after he suffered a hamstring injury

the 29yearold was substituted during tuesdays 10 defeat by atletico madrid and was limping when he left the stadium liverpool stayed overnight in spain but henderson felt sore before the flight home

how long henderson is out will become clear after a scan today but liverpool are already resigned to him missing monday nights clash with west ham

liverpool are anxious over the fitness of jordan henderson after picking up a hamstring injury

the liverpool captain was forced off on tuesday and is undergoing scans on his fitness

they face a busy spell in the coming weeks with premier league fixtures against watford and bournemouth sandwiching the fa cup fifthround match at chelsea as well as the home leg of their last16 champions league tie against atletico on march 11

whether henderson is absent for one game or more it will be a major blow for jurgen klopp because his skipper has been in outstanding form over the past four months and is favourite to be named pfa player of the year

liverpool for once failed to come up with answers to the test atletico set them on tuesday and losing a big game is not a feeling the squad have been familiar with over the past 12 months

the onegoal deficit however is hardly beyond retrieval

club staff are concerned the 29yearold may miss a key period of the season with the problem

its going to be a difficult game said defender virgil van dijk when asked to assess liverpools prospects of turning things around in the second leg

but we should be confident we cant let this defeat bring us down in any way at all were never happy with losing

its been a while as well but we have to believe in ourselves like we always do were frustrated we lost but still have another 90 minutes

we have to be patient but atletico have shown over the last couple of years that its very difficult to score goals and break them down

irfan tamboli head of sales  market insights reports ; sandy utah abc4 news  after a workout at 24 hour fitness late saturday night dan hill found himself locked inside

confused as to how he could get locked in a 24hour gym hill told abc4 news he didnt want to open the door because he knew the security alarms would sound and the cops might think he broke in

calling friends and family about what to do hill said some told him just to walk out others said to call 911 and his wife told him to find a comfortable place to sleep

so i called dispatch and the guy pauses for like 10 seconds and says youre where hill said and i said im in 24 hour fitness and theres an alarm system here and i dont want to get busted for breaking and entering

in the meantime he posted on facebook saying i am literally locked inside 24 hour fitness right now they closed the doors and went home while i was swimming my laps in the pool doesnt the name suggest that they stay open 24 hours

i just thought it was kinda funny at the start you know it was kinda like home alone hill said like oh my gosh i have this gym to myself

spending more than an hour inside what hill thought was a 24hour gym he posted another photo on facebook with the caption free at last free at last thanks to three nice cops i am free at last

with more than 11000 likes and nearly 5000 shares and counting hill said he didnt know his experience would go viral but said its a funny memory he wont forget any time soon

and as for the gym a manager at the sandy location showed abc4 news a sign on the door that says its open monday to sunday from 4 am to midnight

the manager said the company changed their hours december 2 at specific locations across the country

in a statement to abc4 news from 24 hour fitness it says ; doncaster rovers are set to welcome alex baptiste into the firstteam fold after the central defenders long injury layoff

the 34yearold has been sidelined with an achilles injury he suffered in the second match of the season at rochdale

but rovers manager darren moore confirmed on thursday that baptiste will be in the first team squad which travels to shrewsbury town on saturday after turning out for the under 23s on tuesday

hes had another 90 minutes in midweek against grimsby and hes done absolutely superb he said

hes trained again with us today and theres been no reaction to it hes had his first full 90 minutes so now hes had 45 70 and 90 so hes more or less there

hes got tremendous experience and again its another one like matty blair who has returned to the first team after a fivemonth absence

weve got him back at this stage and its wonderful to have alex back hes worked tremendously hard and he looks there or thereabouts

baptiste joined rovers last summer following a successful trial but was injured in only his second game for the club

he is out of contract in may but speaking earlier this week revealed his main focus has been regaining his fitness ahead of the seasons climax

im out of a job in may he said ill just work as hard as i can i dont know what is going to happen

im just so happy to be back and involved in the squad and getting back towards playing again

im just taking it day by day and what happens in may happens

i want to get in there and give it my best shot to see what happens ; the 1980s were known for big hair mtv the fall of the berlin wall and flamboyant and fun fitness instructor richard simmons ruling over the world of vhs aerobics workouts

simmons was perhaps the first aerobics teacher to include people of all sizes in his videotape and slimmons instudio classes

heres what we know about what the reclusive fitness personality is up to now plus what his current net worth is

as a young man simmons was already by the age of 19 weighing in at 268 pounds and was working as a model in italy performing in over 100 commercials

then in 1968 he discovered a note written anonymously on the windshield of his car it said dear richard fat people die young please dont die it frightened simmons that someone who knew him and knew his name felt such pity and concern to leave him such a note

horrified he went on an extreme diet losing over 100 pounds in less than three months he exercised to exhaustion tried hypnosis and consumed diet pills

i ended up looking like a thin glad bag he told people in 1981 my hair fell out my skin drooped my breath was foul and my mood matched

his discipline thankfully was not shortlived within ten years he was lording over a fitness empire with exercise videos his own tv show books and celebrity appearances simmons had become an icon

the 71yearold slowly ebbed away from the pinnacle of fame he still from time to time held classes and made public appearances but suddenly around 2014 he was nowhere to be seen abruptly he held no more classes ended correspondences and simply stopped taking calls his friends and fans became worried

one fan in particular dan taberski got proactive with his concern and started a podcast missing richard simmons that became an instant hit

in 2012 i was living in los angeles and i heard that richard was still teaching taberski told vogue in 2017 you could still take his class in beverly hills for 12 bucks i couldnt believe it

taberski took advantage of those classes he and simmons became friends and even talked by phone from time to time and then all of a sudden richard stopped returning my calls taberski said i realized he had stopped returning everyones calls

richard simmons spent the past four decades reaching out to people who were isolated and alone taberski continued showing them kindness and i like to think that its our turn to return the favor and thats this project

i talked to dozens of people who love him and have worked with him for years they want him to know hes loved and respected and cared for and this is a great way of doing that

the los angeles police even got involved at that time amid concerns that simmons was being held in his home against his will or ill officers checked on simmons and confirmed he was alright

the sweatin to the oldies instructor finally resurfaced to reassure those in a tizzy about his absence that he was absolutely fine and planned on getting back in action

no one is holding me in my house as a hostage simmons told savannah guthrie on today in 2016 all the people that are worrying about me i want to tell them that i love them with my whole heart and soul and not to worry richards fine you havent seen the last of me ill come back and ill come back strong

simmons fellow video fitness legend billy blanks of tae bo fame echoed his friends comments this week in a conversation with the blast the kickboxing phenom predicted his friend will be back soon and strong

i think he needed that private time  to get himself together i think thats what hes doing and i think soon hell be back

richard simmons has been around so long helping people blanks said i think he needed to take time off for himself because when you get to the point where you dont see yourself anymore then you lose yourself

while simmons can certainly live off his net worth of 15 million according to celebritynetworth well have to wait and see if blanks is right and that simmons will make a comeback in 2020 ; hyderabad a report says that hyderabad ranks seventh in overall fitness in india and 11th in the effort ranking effort made by citizens

the report presents a holistic overview on health and lifestyle of indian citizens along with citywise data including stats from the city of hyderabad

the current state of indias health and how far away india is from the goal of having a long lifespan is indicated in the goqii india fit report 2020  indias ikigai the old know better but the young dont care

the study evaluates the health of users basis the health risk assessment hra that recorded the data on a daily basis that is tracked by users on the app

hra considers factors such as current body statistics medical parameters current nutrition physical activity stress sleep alcohol smoking current illness lifestyle diseases immunity levels symptoms or health indicators

as per the study 616 of the people in hyderabad fall in the unhealthy category which is the same as the country average at 62 with the city being pharma and it hub approximately 20 of people complain of aches and pains largely owing to their sedentary desk jobs

this is higher than the countrys average of 18 people complaining of aches and pains the average step count clocked by the people of hyderabad is 7302 steps and ranks 8th in the country

it ranks 10th in terms of sleep and 11th in terms of water thus hyderabad is strictly below average in its efforts to get healthier with a lower number of steps water and sleep

the study indicates that hyderabad has recorded the 3rd highest instances of menstrual problems with 19 of women suffering from irregularities period pain heavy flow in comparison to other cities the percentage of women facing thyroid issues is higher at 106

the saving grace for hyderabad is that there is lower percentage of people encountering lifestyle diseases such as diabetes cholesterol and blood pressure compared to the rest of india

according to the report hyderabad has the least percentage of people suffering from blood pressure issues with low systolic levels recorded in the city

however the city ranks 14th when it comes to stress management thereby indicating that people need to manage their stress levels better by adopting a healthy lifestyle ; spreading a cloth on the table using a row of beverage cans as net qi yuan with his parents help can now play table tennis inside their home

spreading a cloth on the table using a row of beverage cans as net qi yuan with his parents help can now play table tennis inside their home

it is a good way to enhance immunity and develop his skills amid the outbreak of the novel coronavirus qi yuans father qi feng living in lanzhou city of northwest chinas gansu province tells xinhua that they keep playing table tennis during this period

by taking table tennis lessons the little boy and his father show great passion for exercising at home

before the virus outbreak qi yuan regularly went to the table tennis club near his home playing with kids his age to keep this habit his father found a new way to help him at home

though the table tennis table is rough and simple its a really interesting experience said qi feng taking indoor practice as a challenge

like qis family many chinese families figured out creative ways to pass the time at home

zhang mengmeng a sixgrade primary school student is skipping rope on a mat

the mat is to reduce the noise zhang said

influenced by the virus outbreak zhangs school postponed the new semester without a specific reopening date through the online teaching provided by the school zhang can take classes such as math and chinese online but not physical education which used to be her favorite

to make up for it zhangs parents encouraged their daughter to do simple physical exercises including rope skipping and aerobics dancing

ive downloaded a lot of videos from the internet to teach her aerobics every evening after dinner we follow the teacher in the video to dance said zhangs mother

young chinese in many places around the country also enjoy various online resources to enrich their lives and enjoy the fun brought by physical exercise

dressed in sportswear the famous world gymnastics champion mo huilan performs a set of aerobics on a livestreaming platform provided by youku a chinese youtubelike video website two of her nephews are following her actions step by step

according to mo the set of aerobics she performed is specially designed by her for children

i think children should do physical exercises at the age of three it would strengthen their physical and mental health and improve their immunity during the live streaming mo said

recently youku invited several world champions to give lectures on indoor exercises providing free training courses for children across the country

in a video catching wide attention on sina weibo the chinese equivalent of twitter a young man demonstrates some basic stretching actions and explains the proper way to do them

the man in the video surnamed song is a senior middlehigh school pe teacher in heze city east chinas shandong province his school has also postponed the new semester due to the epidemic he came up with the idea of online teaching and the video quickly grew in popularity

the epidemic urges students and their parents to attach more importance to keeping fit said li shaocheng a professor with the department of pe at lanzhou university gansu province

stayathome fitness also reflects that chinese people are quite optimistic during challenging times and it has become vogue recently li said but both parents and children must be aware of possible dangers and choose suitable ways of indoor exercises ; london reuters  only a fraction of people who run do so because they love it and most are motivated by boosting their body image and improving their heart and mental health according to a global survey by the fitnesstracking app strava

strava which tracks the sports activity trends of some 50 million people in almost 200 countries surveyed 25000 runners and found that half of them say they either hate it or barely tolerate it while only 8 love it

but running is often connected with a sense of stability at a deeper level strava said in a report of the surveys findings runners described the need to run to maintain their sense of self and as a way to respond to adversity

theres a great realization that to exercise the body also helps to exercise the mind  which is a muscle that needs just as much looking after as the other muscles said simon klima stravas global marketing director

and love it or hate it the vast majority of runners cited health as a primary motivator for getting out and clocking up the miles more than 80 said they started running to get healthier stronger or have more energy

in brazil 22 of amateur runners said theyd taken up the sport due to a health scare that compares with just 2 in the united states there almost half of respondents said building strength was a core motivator to run  and this was even higher  at 54  among us women

german runners were the most likely of the nations surveyed to cite body image as a reason to run  at 47  and in japan 15 say they run to combat feelings of anxiety and depression

klima sees this as a sign of the times with social media networks putting pressure on people for how they look its driving up the motivating factor of body image he said

the why we run survey  which included respondents from nine countries in north america south america asia and europe  showed how runners worldwide share many common traits

it clustered runners into five key types based on the benefits they value and the extent to which they race or run in social groups

they ranged from passionate runners who run in many social settings and reap the psychosocial benefits like accomplishment and happiness to mindful runners  who tend to run alone  to reluctant runners who rarely compete in races and perceive the fewest social or psychological benefits of all runner types ; tuilagi and slade have been recovering from respective groin and ankle injuries but are on course to be available for the twickenham showdown on sunday

manu trained fully today so should be in contention for selection its good to have a quality player back head coach eddie jones said on wednesday

slade trained today so we have just got to monitor slades progress positive chance quality player it gives us more options

ollie devoto who won his second cap as a replacement off the bench at the stade de france on february 2 is a doubt because of a back problem

england have been hit by the loss of prop mako vunipola who has returned home to tonga for family reasons

makos a quality player but we are lucky we are blessed with two outstanding loosehead props in joe marler and ellis genge so we can recover the loss of mako jones said ; man utd have received a double fitness boost as there are positive updates on pair victor lindelof and scott mctominay

as noted by the clubs official site lindelof was forced to miss the win over chelsea on monday night due to illness and so there were perhaps doubts over his availability in midweek

see more pundit urges solskjaer to drop lost manchester united star

the red devils face club brugge in the first leg of their europa league roundof32 tie and as per the clubs site the swedish defender has travelled with the rest of the squad for the encounter

that would suggest that he has recovered sufficiently to be considered available for selection but considering how eric bailly impressed against chelsea lindelof may find it difficult to force his way back into the starting lineup immediately

in turn its a selection headache that boss ole gunnar solskjaer will welcome and it remains to be seen what he decides to go with for this particular encounter

meanwhile the same report adds that mctominay returned to full training on wednesday as he steps up his recovery from a knee injury and although he wont feature against brugge its still a big positive for united that he is seemingly on the verge of making his comeback

the 23yearold has made 21 appearances already this season chipping in with three goals and an assist and prior to his injury setback he was undoubtedly an important part of solskjaers plans

with that in mind having him back for the business end of the campaign will be a huge boost for man utd as hell add another key option in midfield as they look to compete on multiple fronts between now and the end of the season ; all the xiaomi mi band devices are easily controlled with the official apps from the company that makes them but some developers are creating apps that are somewhat different and which provide some extra features

in the field b impatiens and a mellifera foraged for pollen away from where their colonies were located in cucurbit fields only a very small percentage of cucurbit pollen grains were found within their corbiculae yet these generalist bees spent time foraging in cucurbit flowers presumably for nectar this foraging behaviour is important because it suggests that bees recognize cucurbit flowers as a nectar source but distinguish that the pollen should be avoided likely using multisensory cues this collection avoidance means that as bees fail to groom pollen attached to their body into their corbiculae more is available for transport and pollination and in fact bumble bees have been found to deposit the most pollen on a per visit basis in cucurbit systems as compared to squash and honey bees this phenomenon could result in an increase in the amount of pollen successfully transferred and a corresponding increase in plant fitness

there are several mechanisms that could explain why generalist bees avoid collecting certain pollens preingestive effects eg physical defenses cues correlated with poor nutrition chemical defenses or chemical tastes deter feeding changing consumption behaviour while postingestive effects which can be predigestive eg bees have different capacities for pollen digestion or toxins reduce nutrient digestibility or postdigestive eg a diet has insufficient nutrients or bees cannot metabolize diet toxins can reduce growth and reproduction through malnutrition or direct toxic effects

preingestive effects were evident in our study with reduced pollen consumption per bee in microcolonies fed both crushed and natural cucurbit pollen treatments compared with microcolonies fed all other diet treatments and a tendency to decrease pollen consumption over time reduced feeding in the cucurbit pollen treatments could be a response to a poor diet or an attempt to minimize consumption of plant defenses in the diet several studies have suggested that animals fed singleplant diets will do worse than on mixed diets but this generalization does not apply to specialist bee species which have evolved to feed exclusively on a small set of plant species in contrast generalist species may increase their feeding to compensate if a diet lacks nutrients and reduce consumption if the diet contains toxins however this pattern does not always hold if the poor diet is lacking in some essential nutrient or contains the wrong ratio of nutrients this pattern is further complicated by possible synergistic interactions between digestibility reducers and direct toxins whereby compensatory feeding due to digestibility reducers would result in the increased consumption of a toxin potentially leading to even lower ultimate consumption in another study b impatiens fed c pepo pollen gained less weight over the seven day study period than bees fed other singlepollen diets or a multifloral diet and some bees in this treatment actually lost weight over the study period these results suggest that c pepo pollen is nutritionally deficient for bumble bees although this study showed no effect of c pepo pollen on mortality or oocyte development although this could be due to the shorter study time our pattern of reduced pollen consumption over time both supports the finding that cucurbit pollen is nutritionally deficient for b impatiens and suggests that pollen traits acting as defenses may deter feeding

our results on pollen consumption over time also provide some evidence for postingestive effects microcolonies of larger average weights fed the solvent and chemistry treatments consumed more pollen over time than smaller microcolonies in the same treatment with microcolonies fed the chemistry treatment consuming more pollen than microcolonies fed the solvent treatment at all weights but did not produce more or larger offspring suggesting compensatory feeding to overcome a predigestive constraint whereby some component of the diet reduced digestibility we would expect this effect to be more pronounced in larger microcolonies which would need to consume proportionally more pollen than smaller microcolonies larger bees fed the chemistry treatment also exhibited significantly more area of melanization in their gut which would imply a postdigestive effect of chemical defenses on the gut

while our results suggest no negative effects of chemical traits alone on microcolony performance we believe they merit further investigation due to the termination of microcolonies once a new offspring was reared to adulthood microcolonies fed the chemistry treatment were not exposed to the treatment for as long as the crushed and natural treatments if that had been the case we may have observed a greater proportion of bees in the chemistry treatment exhibiting gut melanization mortality or other fitness effects in addition our chemical extraction method can only succeed in isolating a subset of the potential chemicals found in cucurbit pollen thus both cucurbit pollen treatments would have a more complex suite of chemicals which could have contributed to the stronger effects in these treatments our results suggested that while there may be subtle effects of chemical defenses on pollen efficiency there are unlikely to be strong mortality effects due to toxins in pollen alone since most studies on toxins in pollen fail to account for the interacting effects of nutrition the strongest effects may occur when toxins interfere with digestion in an already poor nutritional diet as in our cucurbit treatments

postingestive effects in b impatiens were also observed in our study in the form of reduced reproduction and increased mortality bees in the crushed and natural cucurbit treatments were unable to rear any offspring to adulthood microcolonies fed natural cucurbit pollen ejected more larvae and microcolonies fed crushed cucurbit pollen had higher proportions of mortality if b impatiens simply cannot digest cucurbit pollen this effect would be predigestive but since we observed severe negative effects in both crushed and natural cucurbit pollen treatments we hypothesized that these effects are primarily postdigestive where cucurbit pollen is either missing essential dietary components andor has physical or chemical properties that interfere with physiological processes

interestingly adults and larvae responded differently to our treatments with adult bees in the natural treatment not exhibiting greater mortality than controls but with no larvae surviving to adulthood this pattern suggests lifestage specific physiological adaptations other studies have also found that digestion is affected by the age of the animal indicating that larval and adult digestion may differ adult bees are capable of reducing their own diet consumption but they may continue to provide larval bees with a set amount of food which could have increased larval exposure to pollen defenses this could explain the increased rates of larval ejection in our natural cucurbit pollen treatment some of these larvae were blackened in appearance suggesting that they were already sick when ejected but some of the larvae appeared to be healthy suggesting that their removal was more likely due to stress in the worker bees this observation supports the hypothesis that deleterious effects of the diet on the adult bees themselves could have contributed to reduced reproduction in our cucurbit treatments malnutrition or increased physiological costs of metabolizing toxins can reduce investment in producing or caring for offspring all of these effects may have worked in concert to prevent any larvae in the crushed or natural treatments from completing their development to adulthood

we also found sizespecific differences in mortality smaller bees fed the solvent control and natural cucurbit pollen had higher mortality risks suggesting that they could have been suffering from increased toxic effects as a result of their small size microcolonies fed the natural cucurbit pollen treatment exhibited high levels of larval ejection and high mortality risk only for small bees the amount of pollen consumed by larval bumble bees determines their size as adults therefore smaller adult bees may already have suboptimal health larger bees also tend to be more dominant and sometimes restrict access to food for smaller bees which could cause smaller bees to become stressed and even more susceptible to the effects of pollen defenses interestingly this effect did not extend to bees in the chemistry treatment if this effect is mediated by a weakened immune system in small bees it is possible that the chemistry treatment bolstered the immune system negating the mortality effects of the solvent dmso alone conversely microcolonies fed the crushed cucurbit pollen treatment exhibited high adult mortality particularly for large bees larger bees have been shown to be less resilient to nectar shortages likely due to a decreased proportion of lipid tissues compared to smaller bees this effect could explain our pattern of larger bees in the crushed treatment having a higher risk of mortality if our manipulation of the crushed cucurbit pollen had exacerbated effects due to malnutrition especially in combination with physical or chemical defenses the crushed treatment may have proven difficult to overcome for the adult bees

while our study was designed to provide evidence for the effects of both malnutrition and physical or chemical pollen traits due to the unexpected strength of the responses in both crushed and natural cucurbit treatments particularly the increased mortality in the crushed cucurbit treatment it is difficult to parse out the mechanisms of these effects such high mortality in the crushed cucurbit treatment was unexpected as we predicted that the natural cucurbit pollen would have the most severe effects on both adults and offspring it is possible that in crushing the cucurbit pollen we changed the pollen by 1 increasing evaporation and drying of the pollen thus reducing its nutritional value 2 increasing the level of chemical defenses by releasing additional chemicals contained within the exine or released as a result of a breakup of compartmentalization that would otherwise have been inaccessible or 3 increasing the level of physical resistance by creating smaller shards of exines that had a more severe effect than the intact exine our pollen consumption data doesnt provide support for the nutritional hypothesis because we failed to find differences in pollen consumption between microcolonies fed the crushed and the natural treatments but our mortality data for bees fed the crushed treatment is consistent with malnutrition having a greater effect on larger bees our dissection data was also able to shed some light on these different hypotheses we found that bees in the crushed treatment were significantly more likely to exhibit gut melanization and hindgut expansion providing support for the hypotheses that additional chemical and physical defenses were present in particular the chemical hypothesis is supported by our finding that larger bees in the chemistry treatment had significantly more area of melanization than bees in other treatments

overall our study provides evidence that pollen defenses impact both larval and adult bees through preingestive and postingestive effects bees were deterred from feeding on cucurbit pollen both in nature and in our lab experiment suggesting some cue indicates the suitability of the pollen diet for consumption when feeding on the cucurbit diet we found that microcolonies suffered severe fitness effects of both increased mortality and reduced reproduction deterrence mechanisms in this system could thus serve as honest signals of defense allowing bees to avoid physiological damage caused by ingesting defended pollen particularly if preingestive defenses are less costly for plants when compared to postingestive defenses this may be an efficient mechanism to reduce pollen loss while minimizing costly defenses we also found that secondary plant chemicals in cucurbit pollen and dmso may act as chemical defenses by reducing the digestibility of nutrients in pollen but more study is needed to verify this finding ultimately it would appear that cucurbit pollen is not an optimal diet for the generalist bumble bee b impatiens our results indicate that cucurbit pollen bears physical nutritional and possibly chemical defenses that are capable of imposing severe physiological costs on both adult and larval b impatiens in contrast with the specialist squash bee e pruinosa which utilizes cucurbit pollen as its sole pollen source without ill effect our results are consistent with the hypothesis that different combinations of these pollen traits could allow plants to selectively attract and deter particular suites of pollinators that have physiological adaptations to different defenses future research should be directed at how widespread pollen defenses are and how they may shape the evolution of pollinator floral preferences understanding how generalist bees respond to pollen defenses can provide new insights into digestive adaptations to the pollen diet as well as elucidate the context for tradeoffs between diet generalization and specialization ; fitness guru ainsley rodriguez showcased just how much her hard work in the gym has paid off in her latest social media share on wednesday she uploaded a photo to instagram in which she flaunted her killer figure in a sexy cutout bikini

ainsleys twopiece was black the top featured an open front with scalloped edges that were loosely laced with a black string the design of the top exposed the center of ainsleys chest calling attention to her ample cleavage the string was tied in a bow at the bottom of the top and the ends hung down over her midsection calling attention to her taut abs the bottoms were a lowcut bikini style with cutouts on the sides

the trainer kept distractions to a minimum as she faced the camera while leaning against a brick wall the wall was painted teal blue a color that not only flattered her bronze skin tone but made it pop ainsley placed one foot on the wall and rested one arm over her head  a pose that put her hourglass shape on display her curvy hips and shapely thighs were also prominent

the beauty flashed a big smile for the picture her hair was slicked back from her face she wore a light application of makeup that included smoky eye shadow and thick lashes she also wore a dark polish on her nails her only accessories were a pair of stud earrings and a dangle bracelet

but once youve settled into a regular routine keeping an eye on where youre at is a great way to keep up motivation and will encourage you to keep trying new challenges keeping fitness as a fun and positive part of your life

for some of us it might be numbersbased noting down the specific weights and repetitions of each workout and noticing how they increase over time

others might prefer a more lifestylebased approach keeping a diary of their energy levels mood and how they feel in their body appreciating the positive changes each week

some will enjoy a visual aid taking a photo or video of themselves doing a certain movement to see how their form or endurance has improved

whichever method you choose its important to go for one that suits you and your goals as this will offer most benefits to you and your motivation

tracking our progress is a great way of celebrating our gym wins but can also help when we feel as though weve stopped moving forward

at the beginning of a new type of exercise every session may offer a chance to achieve some kind of personal best as its something weve never done before and we dont yet know where our limits lie

as we start to reach those limits it can feel as though were no longer improving but this is rarely the case  with a little effort and consistency over time were sure to keep those achievements coming

thats where tracking helps by noticing small successes each week we feel far more motivated to keep coming back for more and we can see ourselves getting closer and closer to those bigger goals

a record of progress is also useful when it comes to highlighting anything that might be preventing you from moving forward whether thats something gymspecific such as poor form or flexibility or related to lifestyle like not getting enough sleep

once you know about these areas you can focus on finding ways to make them better which in turn will allow you to overcome them keep moving forward

and remember you dont have to do this all alone  checking in with a coach or personal trainer about your progress and asking them for help in the areas youre finding difficult is a fantastic way to keep on track and gain some friendly support through your fitness journey ; new delhi senior india fast bowler ishant sharma saturday passed the fitness test at the national cricket academy in bangalore and will now join the team in new zealand for the twomatch test series starting february 21

so mike fitch an american strength coach personal trainer and injury rehabilitation expert who designed the animal flow workout conducts workshops around the world where he teaches the entire set of movements as they were meant to be done

there are six components the first is a basic wrist mobilisation then comes activation which are movements aimed at waking up the body and readying it for the workout

the third is a set of formspecific stretches fourth is travelling forms where you combine movements to get from one spot to another then come switches and transitions where you use targeted exercises to move from one position to another and the last is flow where all the components come together in a choreographed workout

a few years ago my friend race car driver scott lagasse jr from st augustine invited me to come along on his champions ride for bicycle safety i like riding my bike and although i was coming off knee surgery i joined in with some of scotts highprofile friends from the racing community to try and help humanize the relationship between cyclists and cars on the road

one of the fun things about the ride was a lap around daytona international speedway and a finish in victory lane fiftyfive miles in we made the final turn south the track loomed in the distance that means the guys in the front of the peloton of about sixty riders kicked it up a notch

they left me behind in bike language they dropped me

thats when i felt a hand in the middle of my back and the rider next to me said hey buddy weve all been there lets go

i recognized seventime nascar champion jimmie johnsons voice immediately i looked at him and im sure i said something incoherent when i glanced at my computer i noticed we were already doing 28 mph jimmie johnson was pushing me riding onehanded doing 28

lets go get them i said as johnson shoved me up to the back of the pack it was my first hint at jimmie johnsons level of fitness

lagasse and his friends ride the champions ride every year during speedweeks in daytona to help raise the profile of bike and vehicle safety anybody whos been riding has had an unpleasant interaction with a vehicle

that includes scott and even jimmie johnson johnson will start on the outside of row three in todays daytona 500 looking for his third victory in the great american race

he announced earlier this year that 2020 would be his final year driving fulltime on the nascar circuit

jimmie has been part of the champions ride since the beginning he rides or runs at each stop on the nascar schedule and when hes home in charlotte being in a sport where safety is part of the rules johnson knows safety between cars and riders is paramount

safety is everything johnson told me at a rest stop during this years ride last thursday morning i think its the responsibility of the cyclist and the motorists to find some common ground there thats the key

jimmie is dedicated to fitness he ran in the daytona halfmarathon last weekend before the busch clash

the half turned out better than the clash he joked

in his home base of charlotte johnson has started numerous fitness initiatives hes shared his passion with everybody

ive enjoyed my journey and i wanted to share it with my friends im impressed with the community of running and cycling and triathlons johnson said

promoting small lifestyle changes among his crew and other crew members in the garage johnson has changed a lot of the perception of fitness in racing

jimmie has changed the sport in that aspect said lagasse who will drive and field two teams fulltime on the trans am circuit this year guys used to think it showed weakness now team owners demand it the drivers are training harder than theyve ever trained crew chiefs pay attention to it even kids coming up now have trainers

lagasse says he used to be a basketball player and used the sport to stay in shape about ten years ago he started riding thanks to his father scott sr

its something we can do together and be competitive scott said of riding with his dad who turns 61 this week scott sr is a two time sports car club of america national champion who still rides

thats probably where some of my passion comes from hes a machine he said

cars and bikes dont mix well on the roads in jacksonville and north florida theres not enough room despite the vast size of our community there are very few bike lanes it hasnt been part of the plan neither group seems to have a good grasp of the laws that govern the road that creates tension instantly

thats where the state of floridas alert today alive tomorrow comes in theyre a state agency that is solely dedicated to car bike and pedestrian safety

they work tirelessly to raise the awareness that both cyclists and motorists need about how to share the road lagasse said before this years champions ride both groups have a shared responsibility alert today alive tomorrows mission is safety

this years ride was in honor of volusia county sheriffs deputy frank scofield who was killed in a bike accident just outside of daytona last june lagasse had ridden with scofield in the past and credits him with the large law enforcement support the ride has year after year

frank had a lot to do with the success of this ride lagasse said as he presented a signed cycling jersey to scofields widow were riding his training route today

despite their sponsorship agreement ending lagasse says hes staying involved with the state agency to help get the word out

theyre emailing me at midnight to ask if ill be a part of an event theyre working all times of day because they believe in what theyre doing scott explained it motivates me to want to do more ; dubai 20th february 2020 wam  hh sheikh hamdan bin mohammed bin rashid al maktoum crown prince of dubai and chairman of dubai executive council on thursday opened the smart salem centre a medical fitness and occupational screening facility

swedish researchers report that very fit longdistance skiers were about 30 less likely to develop parkinsons disease during their 20year study

the research suggests that any activity that keeps you fit might buffer the brain against disease

our study highlights the importance of staying physically active throughout life in order to have a reserve to better cope when the frailties and diseases of old age inevitably arrive said study senior author tomas deierborg hes an associate professor in neuroscience at lund university in sweden

deierborg said the researchers believe these very fit athletes have built up a greater motor reserve that slows any brain damage from parkinsons disease he said its similar to the idea of cognitive reserve in people with dementia that suggests someone who is welleducated can sustain more brain damage from dementia before symptoms of the disorder become obvious

however not everyone is convinced that motor reserve is playing a role in this studys findings

dr michael okun national medical director for the parkinsons foundation said theres definite agreement among experts that exercise has positive effects on parkinsons disease and many positive effects beyond parkinsons disease but its wishful thinking for us to assume that longdistance skiers have some sort of motor reserve theres just not a lot of data yet

parkinsons disease is a neurodegenerative disorder that often develops slowly over years the exact cause is still unknown according to the parkinsons foundation

the disease may progress differently from one person to the next symptoms often include tremors often at rest other symptoms include slow movements rigid limbs and gait problems

the study followed the health of nearly 200000 longdistance skiers for more than two decades and compared them to a control group from the general population in sweden

the skiers were an average of 36 years old slightly less than twothirds were male all had participated in the vasaloppet long distance crosscountry ski race the race is 90 kilometers about 56 miles long

deierborg said the skiers are very fit as they just participated in one of the longest crosscountry ski races in the world he said most of them skied for at least four hours a week and in general they had higher leisuretime physical activity than the average person in the swedish population they also tended to have better diets

in addition the rate of smoking was far less in the skiers only about 1 smoked compared to around 15 of the general population deierborg noted

compared to the general population the vasaloppet skiers appeared to have a 29 lower risk of developing parkinsons disease over 15 years of followup however the difference in parkinsons cases weakened

deierborg said he doesnt think these benefits are limited to these welltrained skiers any kind of activity would likely reduce the risk of parkinsons he said

on that point okun agreed exercise is good for parkinsons disease you dont need to be an olympiclevel athlete

okun said people with parkinsons disease should participate in a level of activity that works for them

the study was published recently in the journal of parkinsons disease

there were question marks over the 96test veterans availability but having successfully come through the fitness test last week he is back in contention

ap

almost as if invigorated by the foray into test cricket of jasprit bumrah ishant has been at his most incisive in the longer format since january 2018 when bumrah made his fiveday debut in south africa

ishant has picked up 66 wickets in 17 tests from january 2018 onwards at a stunning average of 1943 and a strikerate of 427 which is fractionally better than bumrahs 437

afp

bumrah averages 1924 per scalp courtesy 62 wickets from 12 matches but staggeringly while the younger quick has played exclusively overseas in south africa england australia and the west indies ishants last four tests have been in india

the delhi pacer will now get another bite at the cherry he has been phenomenal in the past seasons and will look to trouble the new zealand batsmen  in conditions that will suit him

silva limped off in the closing moments at the etihad stadium on wednesday after being caught by a crunching tackle from west hams angelo ogbonna

guardiola immediately asked silva about the extent of the injury on the touchline and while he does not think the problem is especially serious there is still some doubt about his availability for the last 16 first leg in spain next wednesday

he told me that he felt something but i dont think it was a big issue guardiola said

i will know on thursday exactly he played really well and we will see in the next days

he told me he had more caution after what happened near the goal we will see with the doctors

citys trip to the bernabeu has taken on added focus in the wake of uefa handing the club a twoyear ban from european competitions for serious breaches of financial fair play regulations

unless city wins their appeal this season will be guardiolas last chance to win the champions league until the 202223 campaign

like silva city winger raheem sterling is also an injury doubt for the real showdown as he recovers from a hamstring problem suffered at the start of the month

but guardiola was boosted by the return against west ham of french centreback aymeric laporte who made only his second appearance since suffering a serious knee injury in august

im happy with the result and being back on the pitch at the etihad the people here push me to do a good job laporte said

to be back playing at home im happy with that it was difficult for me being out of the team for this long time but im happy to be back with my teammates

smith emphasised that some players have joined the pretournament training camp in less than ideal fitness condition star sports understands that only one player outside of the regular west indies senior team members rashada williams attained the minimum fitness standard set out by cricket west indies

for smith it is the norm for players to enter camps well below the required fitness standard however he adds that the practice continues to affect the programme

some of the players wait until they come back in camp to get fit and that is not ideal we have had to overlook some players in the past because they are not up to the fitness standard that is required said smith

currently there are 15 players in training from thursday to sunday since january 13 smith added that he has had to design special programmes for players to get them up to speed

some of the players are not disciplined enough to maintain certain fitness standards outside of camp and they will come back half or a little over halffit and we have to work hard to get them to where we need to be some players train often and you can see the difference but we are working to get things right added smith

despite the slight setback smith mentioned that training has been going well with the players doing a lot of physical fitness and technical work in the nets

in the meantime the squad will have two practice matches this weekend as they continue to finetune their preparations among those who will turn out in the 50 over and t20 matches on saturday and sunday are jamaica under19 captain nicole campbell as well as the wilmot sisters kate and kade wilmot all from portland

by doing strength training exercises were going to maintain your strength

i hear the club i want to lose weight in my arms for females

in the caption stephanie explained the proper form for doing these lifts and you can see her using a lot of these instructions in her video but she also included aspects of the exercise that werent that apparent in the clip for example she mentioned taking a deep breath while expanding the stomach before lifting the weight she also instructed viewers to push their feet hard into the floor during the lift to get it off of the floor

the video has been viewed close to 120000 times since it was uploaded to instagram on friday in the comments section fans shared their appreciation for stephanies demonstration

10 steps to deadlift   1 set your feet roughly hip width apart with the bar under the knot of your shoes or roughly 1cm away from your shins 2 screw your feet firmly into the floor and maintain 3 contact points at all times big toe little toe heel 3 grab the bar with your hands in line with your shoulders using either a mixed grip or hook grip 4 keep your arms as straight as possible while pulling your elbows together to switch on your lats  5 take a big breath and either push your stomach into the belt or simply expand your belly like youre pregnant if you lift beltless 6 anchor yourself hard down into the floor by pulling on the bar 7 push your feet hard through the floor like a leg press to get the bar moving off the floor  8 keep the bar close to the body at all times 9 pull the bar into your hips   push your hips through to meet the bar and flex your glutes and quads   i know this is a very comprehensive list but dont get overwhelmed   just tackle one point at a time and gradually work on refining your technique over time   it doesnt have to be perfect and will rarely ever be perfect  but its something to work towards  deadlifting conventionaldeadlift powerlifters

finally mohamed elyounoussi recently returned to action following a foot problem playing for 85 minutes against clyde in the scottish cup and 18 minutes against hearts in the league in midweek transfermarkt

lennon covered all four players in his prematch press conference ahead of the league game at pittodrie telling the celtic website jeremie trained yesterday bitton and elhamed have been training so theyre into the groove and mo is more or less fit now as well

its hard to leave players out who are in form sometimes its a game of patience for the players coming back in but with the amount of games coming up its important to rotate players we were able to do that at the weekend and we were able to give some players a break on wednesday night when they were comfortable in the game

mumbai fast bowler ishant sharma has cleared his fitness test at the national cricket academy nca in bengaluru and is set to join the india squad in new zealand for the twotest series

espncricinfo understands sharma will fly out on sunday today and join the squad in wellington the venue of the first test starting february 21

sharma had injured his right ankle during a ranji trophy game against defending champions vidarbha nearly a month ago and had been looking doubtful for the test series in new zealand having been advised six weeks rest with a grade three tear he later went to the nca for rehab and was named in the test squad subject to clearing his fitness

sharma will join jasprit bumrah mohammed shami umesh yadav and navdeep saini in the pace attack sharma was also the leading wickettaker the last time india toured new zealand in 201314 with 15 scalps from two tests and the only bowler to claim two fivefors in the series

sharma has been the leader of indias pace attack in tests in recent years helping the team strengthen their grip at the top of the icc rankings and taking all 360 points in the ongoing world test championship

he has been indias secondhighest wickettaker since the beginning of the 201718 season only behind shami with 74 wickets from 19 matches at an average of 2017 and strike rate of 437

gut health gut bacteria and their role in our overall health immune systems and even brain function have become part of almost every howtolivehealthy guide

a healthy gut can boost immunity elevate mood even keep obesity and diabetes at bay there are initiatives dedicated solely to studying gut microbiome like the american gut project british gut project eu mynewgut project

indian guts are a belly apart read on to find out a little more about why as well as how to care better for your gut

stomach rumblings

researchers from indian institute of science education and research bhopal and the national centre for microbial research pune have found the gut microbiome of healthy indians to be different from those of healthy people from china the us and denmark

they liken it to the difference between flora and fauna in different ecosystems in the same way that you dont find the same plants and animals in delhi as you do in denmark the kinds of bacteria that you find in the gut differ from region to region

thats because gut microbiota is easily influenced by diet environment and genetics says professor nk ganguly president of the gut microbiota and probiotic science foundation gmpsf india a nonprofit organisation focused on educating health care professionals

the western diet is high in fat and protein whereas ours tends to be high in carbs and fibre adds dr neerja hajela secretary of the gmpsf hence there are different sets of microbiota determining the functioning of the western and indian gut

the different diets traditionally followed are part of the reason for these differences there is no scientific evidence to suggest that western probiotic rich foods will not work as well for the indian gut or vice versa but it will take longer for the stomach to adjust to an unfamiliar foodstuff well enough for it to work as well dr hajela says

gut superfoods for you

to promote the growth of good gut bacteria indians should eat more wholegrain wheat oats millets and bajra for fiber green vegetable like kale spinach and broccoli are also good for the indian gut says dr hajela

dr amreen shaikh head dietician and nutritionist with wockhardt hospital mumbai suggests having a bowl of curd or a glass of buttermilk every day and  or haldi doodh hot milk with turmeric traditionally these were the foods that boosted gut bacteria in indians and they remain the ones likely to work best

in addition shaikh suggests adding spices like coriander cumin fennel seeds ginger and garlic to soups and gravies as they aid digestion and boost gut health

traditional fermented foods like idlis dosas and dhoklas are rich in probiotics  living microorganisms that help restore gut flora along with being easily available these preparations are also more suited to the indian gut since theyre familiar foods

dr roy patankar director of mumbais zen multispecialty hospital says its important to check that the yoghurt youre consuming contains lactobacillus since its often missing in storebought varieties

theres also this fad of consuming probiotic tablets if youre doing so see that its not the variety that gets destroyed by hydrochloric acid in the gut he says also dont ingest the same probiotics for months at a time it works better to have a rotation where you switch sources every two weeks ; dancers rock out for fun and fitnesspeter sweeneygeraldton guardian saturday 15 february 2020 1256pm

former leeds united centreback alex bruce believes the fitness demands of head coach marcelo bielsa could be the reason behind leeds recent dip in form

the whites have won just two of their last 11 championship outings losing five times during that period meaning their premier league promotion assault has suffered a major blow in recent weeks

though leeds produced a muchimproved performance during tuesday nights 11 draw with brentford at griffin park there are still plenty of concerns about the current form of the elland road club who host bristol city on saturday

and former defender bruce who spent two years at elland road believes that the fitness levels demanded by bielsa could be a key reason behind the clubs recent wobbles insisting that leeds players could be shattered

speaking to football insider bruce who racked up 33 appearances during his time with the whites said when you consider what people say about his training techniques he works them really hard double sessions this that and the other

are they getting to the point of the season now where youre seeing the players are tired if he was sat here hed probably say no this is the way ive always managed this is the way i do it so you like it or lump it

who would i be to sit here and say his beliefs are right or wrong its the way he wants to do things but that would be the natural thing to point at him at the moment

well are your players shattered

it is little secret that bielsa demands such high levels of fitness from his players especially when you take into account just how often they come out at the start of a game allguns blazing

but on the flip side of that leeds blew a threegoal lead against cardiff city back in december and conceded two goals inside the final 10 minutes against sheffield wednesday last month suggesting that tiredness can creep in when looking to see games out ; karachi feb 15 pti pakistan batsman umar akmal has escaped a ban from the pakistan cricket board pcb for allegedly making crude remarks to a trainer during a fitness test at the national cricket academy in lahore

move you fat git

thats the message i frequently take from the little buzz that arrives through my wrist at 10 minutes to the hour while sitting at my desk

if i havent walked 250 steps in 50 minutes my fitbit vibrates to warn me i have been too static and to get moving an easy habit to slip into for office workers

more often than not it prompts me to rise walk to the water machine or make a coffee to please my device and get the steps in before its too late and the hour ticks over

stat attack my fitbit device shows how many steps ive taken my heart rate calories burnt mileage covered  and the time

this gamifcation of exercise is all part of the wider statistics the device  linked to an app on my phone  spits out each day with 10000 steps being the target

since i picked up the fitness tracker in november i have let it influence my daily habits somewhat mainly by making time for extra walks

data is the new oil  or at least that is the claptrap some peddle personally i do find it interesting to see how many steps ive taken miles ive covered how ive slept my average heart rate and how much ive sat still on a given day

i am a journalist who deals in statistics and figures  i love nothing more than trawling spreadsheets for trends and crunching data

others might find that entirely dull i may come to a point soon where i too find it boring  or a bit too like an episode of the dystopian satire black mirror as i walk around frantically glancing at how many steps im doing

but at the moment i quite like to find out my sleep score on a scale of 100 and what percentage of my day i spend on my backside

and the fact that i see plenty of others walking around checking the fitness tracker on their wrist suggests i am not alone

for many the worry is how companies such as fitbit or apple with its smartwatches use all this data fitbit is currently in the process of being bought by google for 21billion

fitbit tell me consumer trust is paramount strong privacy and security guidelines have been part of our dna since day one

we will continue to put users in control of their data and will remain transparent about the data it collects and why

the company never sells personal information or fitbit health and wellness data

its privacy policy states that if the google takeover is completed it will give affected users notice before transferring any personal information to a new entity

popular wearable technology to track fitness steps and sleep have become big business in the last decade  will it continue stock image

the perfect valentines gift

wearable technology has been a fast moving trend in the last decade fitness tracker sales themselves have dipped off slightly in recent years with more people wanting smartwatches

an estimated third of britons have some sort of fitness tracker while fitbit itself has nearly 30million users globally

this is likely to rise when it releases it releases its annual report this thursday which will give a more uptodate snapshot

it has been one of the fastest growing trends of the decade millennials are the most likely to own one and those aged 5575 the least likely according to statista data

it is forecast that 1billion of the global population will have one  or a smartwatch that does the same thing  by 2030

even my wife who couldnt understand the appeal before i started using mine requested one as a valentines gift

its not quite a set of scales but it doesnt feel far off she wants to measure how many steps she makes each day as she feels her smartphone tracker isnt an accurate depiction she has succumbed

there is no way im letting it track my sleep she has told me sternly though i bet she will its a curiosity itch too good not to scratch

a fitness tracker transformed my life consumer trends

this is money assistant editor and consumer journalist lee boyce writes his consumer trends column every saturday

it ranges from food and drink and retail to financial services and travel

have an idea or suggestion get in touch

leeboycethisismoneycouk

one adopter of the technology is my mum

last july for her birthday my sister bought her a relatively inexpensive fitness tracker

she was once a heavy smoker but gave up in 2005

however six years ago she was diagnosed with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease  or copd  thanks to the cigarettes

it is estimated around 3million britons have the condition

unfortunately it left her short of breath and made it impossible to even go for short walks with her and my daughter born in 2018

when she received the gift last summer little did we know it would kickstart my mums health and result in her losing around a stone and a half in weight

she has slowly built up her fitness to the point now where last weekend she walked five miles to my house from hers which includes plenty of hills leaving me gobsmacked

six months ago my retired mum would have struggled to walk for five seconds out of the house without wheezing she goes for morning meanders afternoon walks and evening strolls  the change in her health is clear to see

now she frequently does 30000 steps a day the equivalent of 15 miles

this wouldnt have happened without that fitness tracker encouraging her

she says i was cynical when i first put that device on but i was shocked into action i saw how few steps i was doing in any given day

i was determined to get to 10000 then 11000 and so on

everyday i have tried to beat my best and i feel healthier than i have done for years  even decades

ive got to the point where i am singing the praises of my fitness trackers to anyone who will listen  it really has changed my life in the last six months

i genuinely never thought that fitness tracker would work and im thankful my sister bought it for her  im looking forward to the summer where we she can accompany her granddaughter and i on walks without becoming breathless a far cry from summer 2019

someone else told me on twitter that they use a tracker as part of managing diabetes with the additional information helpful in a number of areas

what ive discovered from predicting illness to how well im going to sleep

i am traditionally a slow adopter to technology mainly over data fears

someone ridiculed me recently because i refuse to give up my paper train ticket for a plastic one and i like to spend cash as much as i do contactless

but after seeing the success my mum had i decided i wanted a fitbit to see if it could help shift my fat bits which have become a little more doughy since becoming a parent

three months later here are some of the titbits ive discovered

it knew i was becoming ill my resting heartbeat is typically in the low 60 beats per minute

however before christmas over a few day period it spiked to nearly 70 loandbehold i came down with an acute virus

weekend spike my heart rate spikes at the weekend the fitness tracker shows me  meanwhile i need to improve on my cardio  my 2020 goal is to get out of the average score

my resting heartbeat spikes at the weekend i am more chilled at my desk than i am at home looking after my daughter

my heartbeat revs up a few beats per minute probably as i fret over keeping a tiny human alive

midweek walks i attempt to get away from my desks most days for a brisk walk to clear my head and burn those all important calories

i walk more as well as the nonactivity prompts i have been inspired to get out at my lunch break at least three times a week to do a 45 minute power walk

this was after i realised i was spending around three quarters of my waking hours nonactive  ie sitting at my desk on the commute home or on the sofa

this helps clear my head get the creative juices flowing and improve my mood

mobile this matrix keeps track of whether youve done your 250 steps each hour while it automatically registers exercise such as brisk walks

motivational messages the app also gives some daily motivation for instance it recently told me

research shows adding two minutes of walking for each hour you sit during the day may be linked with a longer life expectancy a twothree minute walks  about 250 steps

and a 30 minute walks or jog may help prevent a buildup of stress during the day aerobic activities help keep levels of cortisol  the stress hormone  in check

both these messages hit home

bad sleep vs good sleep the screenshot on the left showed a particularly bad night sleep  the one on the right a good one along with the period you slept deep light or in rem

sleeping like a baby as a relatively new dad i was interested to see how parenthood was hitting my sleep

it breaks it down into deep sleep light sleep rem and awake i can now pinpoint the exact moments my daughter wakes in the night or the cat comes in and decides to paw my face

it can also give me an indication as to why im feeling tired the next day and the effects booze has on your sleep

in the past 30 days i typically spent 51 per cent of my sleep in light mode this the app explains makes up the most of your night and promotes mental and physical restoration

i spent 20 per cent in deep sleep which helps with physical recovery and aspects of memory and learning the app adds that if you spend solid time in this stage youre likely to feel extra refreshed

meanwhile i spend 17 per cent in rem  rapid eye movement sleep this typically occurs later at night and is apparently important for your memory and mood this is the stage where dreams are more vivid heart rate is elevated and breathing is faster

sleep the tracker measures your sleep out of 100 with 80 being good and also gives you a 30 day average along with a benchmark of other your gender and age

competition increases exercise four of my colleagues also use fitbits in the app you can set up a league table with others

upon much ridicule of our nonfitbit colleagues the five of us embarked on a few days of frantically checking the table and trying to outdo each other

as a result most of added thousands more steps than we usually would it also encourage far more walking to each others desks then simply emailing

leaving it behind anxiety there have been a couple of occasions where i have left my tracker at home it definitely has an impact  its almost like having a cheat day

its replaced my watch out has gone the hugo boss number i wore whats the point of wearing a watch that doesnt nothing else but tell the time

all of the above was recorded on a fitbit inspire hr device that i picked up for 6999 from curryspc world not all fitness trackers have the features above so research the models before purchase

will the trend continue

wearable technology is ranked the number one fitness trend of 2020 as it has been since 2016 by 2023 the market is set to be worth half a billion pounds

some companies now offer the gadgets for free as long as users get the right amount of steps

where could this lead to the future cheaper insurance for those who are more active medical bills for those not doing enough or refusing to wear one

fitbit itself has launched a premium service it almost like a statdriven weight watchers with guided programs more detailed health insights advanced sleep tracking and tailored workouts it costs 80 a year

it even has its own scales which measures weight body fat percentage and bmi and puts them into a neat little graph

in the last 12 years fitbit tells me it has created the largest global health database it has 228billion hours of heart rate data 202trillion steps logged 517billion minutes of exercise and 105billion nights of sleep

it claims that three quarters of users with a weight loss goal with a fitbit lose weight and users get 10 minutes more sleep with one

the two are linked it says as there is a 12 per cent higher chance of losing weight with seven hours sleep per night

when i was 16 i wrote a list of things i wanted to achieve in my life one was to buy a an antique rolex  i think i have waved goodbye to that dream thanks to technology

a rolex wouldnt vibrate to tell me to stop being lazy no matter how beautiful it looks that said it wouldnt hold precious data about me and my lifestyle

i lost nearly half my weight

one fitbit user ashleigh from glasgow who works in a drama school tells me that she lost 9 stone after using a fitbit thanks to a health scare

she had to have an emergency operation and when she came round the doctor told her if it wasnt an emergency then they wouldnt have operated because of her size

after joining a few weight loss programmes with little success she decided to jump on the fitness tracker bandwagon

she started to become competitive with herself and at the end of each day if she had not done enough steps she would jog around her flat

she went from 19 stone to 10 stone she says i never considered weight loss to be linked to social and wellbeing but by reclaiming control over my body ive gained new friends and built up confidence to do things in the community that i wouldnt have been brave enough to do before

i just keep thinking just keep going dont stop now

just seeing how many calories i burn when exercising helps me to eat better and gain a better understanding about what my body needs to keep me fit and healthy

i think community and friendship has been at the heart of my journey

i hadnt realised how lonely id been before i started this journey id isolated myself from this amazing community of people all around me and one day it just felt like by achieving my weight goals i was rewarded with friendship a community of likeminded people to keep me going

it was something id never expected to find but id be lost without now

within a couple of months judith nyman secondary school in brampton went from having old fitness equipment that was on its last legs to brand new stateoftheart workout facilities  all thanks to a teacher who advocated for an upgrade

honestly i was really happy said shaqheim carty a grade 11 student at the school

before when we used to have all the old weights there wasnt much for me to do but then when i saw the new stuff i thought it would be great to help with my future career in boxing

the new cardio and weight rooms were ready on monday and students have already been asking if they can visit after school hours

the dream became a reality simply because one teacher asked for help

we realized we had a situation where if we didnt have a remedy within the next five years we start to look at not having access to any weight training equipment because it was getting older and red flagged with safety concerns said greg wright the schools head of physical and health education

replacing them gets to be a bit tricky when youre looking at 10000 just for one piece

after doing some research on where he could get some assistance modernizing the facilities he reached out to goodlife fitness last year

he outlined what the schools needs were and why the students were deserving after a few months of communication and a visit from goodlifes team it started to come to fruition

we gave them our number one wildest dream scenario  they didnt even blink he said

the goodlife team transformed an old gym room and a weightlifting room with rundown equipment into a modern cardio room and a stateoftheart weighttraining room

the kids were also given tshirts hats bags and water bottles

they exceeded our dreams wright said

robert lompart principal of the school said the peel district school board got to work right away updating the infrastructure to support the makeover

everyone rallied he said

the electrical team maintenance team the painters all came in and said what can we do to expedite this

lompart said the process of converting the rooms took about two months

many of our students are used to being marginalized he said and now theyre sitting here so excited to have the best fitness and weight room in the board

in a statement jane riddell president and coo of goodlife fitness said she hopes the new equipment sparks the students passion for health and physical activity

when we learned about the challenges facing the student population at judith nyman we were grateful for an opportunity to make this donation and share the joys of physical activity with them the statement reads

were especially appreciative of the hard work of our club services team who installed the new equipment and to the school staff who advocated on the students behalf

jaheim carty shaqheims twin brother welcomes the new equipment

looks like i wont be lazy anymore he joked

it makes me feel really special because now that we have all this neat stuff it makes me excited because i get to stay more fit ; her best advert rachael finch shows off her washboard stomach and trim pins in a purple bikini as she plugs sixweek body challenge

the said incident occurred late last month when all the players who hold central and domestic central contracts were directed to take fitness tests at the nca ahead of the home series against bangladesh and the pakistan super league

during the body fat test umar got frustrated after failing the other tests and made some crude remarks to the trainer while undressing the trainer is understood to have reported the matter to misbahulhaq who is head coach and chief selector and he asked the board to hold an inquiry

the pcb has said in a statement that after concluding its proceedings into the alleged misconduct by umar during a fitness test and after listening to all the parties involved it was established that the incident happened due to misunderstanding

umar akmal has offered his regrets for his actions and the pcb has reprimanded him and also reminded him about his responsibilities as a senior cricketer the pcb said

the matter is now closed and the pcb and umar akmal will offer no further comments the statement concluded

umar who is just 26 last played a test for his country in september 2011 but he has been in and out of the white ball squads his last appearance coming in a t20 international against sri lanka at lahore last october

after the board appointed their senior official and former test batsman haroon rasheed as head of the inquiry committee it was expected that umar would be fined and also banned probably from the national oneday cup due after the psl

but the youngest of the akmal brothers apologized and expressed regrets for his reaction during the fitness test and requested the board for leniency

umar is no stranger to controversies while continuing to show off his talent at the domestic level including a dashing double hundred in the quaideazam trophy final in karachi in january ; south sydney forward ethan lowe will undergo a fitness test on saturday to assess whether he can take the field for day two of the nrl nines in perth

controversial pakistani wicketkeeper batsman umar akmal had come under the scanner after misbehaving with a trainer at pakistans national cricket academy nca in lahore it was expected that the pakistan cricket board would take some strict action against akmal for his alleged misconduct however the pcb officials have decided against it

ahead of the home series against bangladesh all the pakistani players reported to the nca to undergo a fitness test even the players taking part in the pakistan super league were present in the academy when akmal reportedly stripped his clothes and asked the trainer to find body fat during the players body fat test

the trainer soon reported to pakistans head coachcumselector misbahulhaq who asked pcb to hold an inquiry for the same almost one month after the incident pcb released the following statement on saturday 15th february

umar akmal has offered his regrets for his actions and the pcb has reprimanded him and also reminded him about his responsibilities as a senior cricketer the matter is now closed and the pcb and umar akmal will offer no further comments issued pcb as quoted by indiatoday

the statement mentions that akmal has regretted over his actions while the board tried to remind him that he was a senior cricketer as well as a role model for the upcoming players such type of behaviour from him is not expected hence he received a warning and the case was shut

pcb announced this decision after listening to both the parties involved in this dispute the case was closed with the conclusion that the aforementioned controversy happened solely because of some miscommunication between akmal and the trainer

just 12 months removed from the glare of being the topranked prospect in baseball the 20yearold native of the dominican republic finds himself facing a spring that is considerably more calm than a year ago

oh the hype is still real as is the flair and the power that is so much a part of vlad jrs baseball presence but if anything its notably understated by the jays themselves as all involved hope that guerrero settles into a more consistent rhythm for his sophomore campaign

much of the clubs marketing initiatives feature bo bichette cavan biggio and hyunjin ryu with guerrero perhaps intentionally left in the background combine that with a successful offseason working out and the young third baseman can certainly feel more at ease

i feel a lot more comfortable now guerrero said on saturday the chemistry on the team is very good weve all been working hard as a team together so im ok with that

among those who believe the expectations were inflated on the rookie last season is his manager charlie montoyo it got to the point that some expected he would hit a home run every time he came to the plate which goes with the territory of his advance billing but was always unrealistic

thats not fair montoyo said i get it because he was the best prospect coming up to the big leagues in a long time he did a good job

the hope of course is that he will do that job even better in 2020 and that he will be fit enough to sustain his strength for a full season guerrero admits he was running on fumes this past september no doubt a big reason he will begin 2020 on a careerlong 27game drought without a home run

what he did this off season  he worked really hard montoyo said he did everything he could he learned from last season he learned that he ran out of games in september and thats why he worked so hard this offseason so that doesnt happen this year

with that in mind the jays will proceed with the intent of guerrero playing 150 games the majority of those at third base

definitely i feel great right now said guerrero who was energetic in a saturday morning full of work both in the batting cage and in fielding drills with thirdbase coach luis rivera

its a big difference right now in terms of taking ground balls when i want to attack the ball the legs feel a lot lighter now theres a big difference

last year there were some balls that i couldnt reach and now im getting there a lot quicker and a lot easier

as for the burnout factor that hampered him late last season guerrero expects to charge through the full season  from late march until the end of september

right now i feel like i can do that that i can play 150 games easily guerrero said i just need to keep working through the spring and hopefully i can do that

bullish bo

bordering on brash but really more a case of firm confidence in his own abilities jays shortstop bo bichette is expecting big things for the team in 2020

i expect us to compete i expect us to do really well bichette said we have a lot more talent than people realize i dont think people are taking into account that some of our guys are going to take steps forward and become really impact players

so like i said im really excited for what could happen this year

the jays certainly expect big things from bichette in his second year montoyo said that he could see the sophomore big leaguer playing upward of 150 games at short

hes always thinking that he can get better and usually thats how good players talk montoya said

thats how he thinks and thats good

while bichette wont let up on his work ethic during the grapefruit league schedule he plans to have a moderately altered approach to his time at bigleague camp a year ago

i felt like i was more in season because i felt like i was trying to impress people bichette said so this spring it will kind of be a happy medium of playing hard and getting ready for the season but also not wasting too much energy

ive got to be ready for opening day

revolving dh

without a true designated hitter on his roster montoyo plans to operate the position with a committee approach and the manager sees that as a good option

the thing about not having a fulltime dh it allows me to rotate people montoyo said

so centre fielder randal grichuk might dh and teoscar hernandez would play centre or the other way around

the dh is going to be rotating throughout the infield and the outfield

by doing so it allows montoyo do one of his favourite things as a manager  spread out playing time among several bodies

i like to play all the guys  having the dh spot open is going to allow me to play more people montoyo said

quick hits

montoyo on former red sox star centre fielder mookie betts leaving the al east as a baseball fan hes fun to watch but im glad hes not in our division any more thats great  in his praise of bichette montoyo essentially said that he doesnt need a backup at shortstop the tentative plan would have brandon drury spell him for 10 games or so and for bichette to handle the heavy workload that he thrives upon ; senior india fast bowler ishant sharma on saturday passed the fitness test at the national cricket academy in bengaluru and will now join the team in new zealand for the twomatch test series starting february 21 ishant cleared his fitness test today and he will be joining the team at the earliest he is available for selection for the first test but final call rests with the team management a bcci source told pti on condition of anonymity

while the first test is set to be played from february 21 to 25 the second test is from february 29 to march 4 the indian team is currently playing a threeday warmup game against a new zealand xi side in hamilton ; thursday feb 11 healthday news  take heed when digging out from the historic snowstorms of 2010 you can suffer serious injuries while shoveling if you dont take the proper precautions

if youre not a regular exerciser or youre in poor physical shape your body wont be prepared for the stress of shoveling snow and you increase your chances of sustaining muscle pulls back injuries and strains snow shoveling can also strain the heart and cause potentially lifethreatening injuries such as a heart attack dr susan wainwright vice chair of the physical therapy department at university of the sciences in philadelphia said in a university news release

wainwright offered the following safety tips for those who plan to tackle the white stuff

some people shouldnt do any snow shoveling wainwright noted men and women over age 45 especially those who arent physically active or have a history of a heart condition should find someone else to clear the snow

the heart is a muscle just like any other muscle in your body and when it gets strained it shuts down because it cant handle the increased load older adults who arent active tax their cardiovascular system when they start to shovel and this often results in heart attacks wainwright explained

snow shoveling doesnt have to be backbreaking work but we have to remember that it is hard work and we need to take precautions to avoid injury she concluded ; when fitness apps first came on the market in 2010 they were heralded as an exciting new way to monitor our fitness levels and motivate us to exercise more

movement sensors and gps tracking on fitness bracelets headbands and smart watches made it possible to trace exact routes and even congratulate us at the end of the run or walk many people embraced the challenge of 10000 steps itself an arbitrary distance that originated in a japanese device manpokei  with new gusto as smartphones counted them for us

in the last 10 years wearable fitness apps have been linked to or replaced by more sophisticated smartphone apps which offer activity tracking personal training videos meal planning daily meditations and motivational articles

prof niall moyna from the department of preventative medicine at dublin city university says their use is expected to increase further over time apps are great motivational tools for those who want to kickstart or maintain exercise programmes selfmonitoring devises that track our health and fitness allow people to take ownership of their fitness and are part of the rise in individualised medicine in the 21st century

it is now estimated that about 10 per cent of all apps are fitness apps the best ones include good demonstration videos and tutorials voiceovers that remind you of things a gym instructor would remind you of allow you to set your own pace and even detect if youre overtraining push notifications offer reminders for scheduled workouts or inspirational quotes to motivate or annoy users

however while this all sounds like technology at its best apart from the notifications which are particularly irritating if you cannot fit in that workout some experts are now highlighting the downsides of fitness apps

a new study at the national university of ireland galway nuig examined how fitness apps affect the wellbeing of the user the research looked specifically at the potential for fitness apps to lead to obsessive behaviour and burnout in the long term

the majority of exercisers are now using digital technology to track and share their workout data to support their fitness goals but these fitness apps can be a doubleedged sword says dr eoin whelan senior lecturer in business information systems at the je cairnes school of business and economics at nuig

dr whelan says that while fitnesssharing apps can help start and sustain exercise routines some users may develop obsessive tendencies and exercise too much

the study found that people who use selftracking on fitness apps to give support and encouragement to others are more likely to have a harmonious approach to their exercise and ultimately lower life stress however people who use selftracking on fitness apps to receive praise and public endorsements for their exercise activities are more likely to develop an obsessive approach to physical exercise and suffer higher life stress over time

fitness app social features which promote selfrecognition such as posting only positive workout data or photos can be linked to maladaptive perceptions of exercise and burnout in the long run says dr whelan in contrast fitness app social features that offer support to colleagues activities are healthier the study found

we have had feedback from companies who make health technologies who are keen to figure out ways to develop digital rewards for people when they shouldnt train

the research which studied 270 people involved in cardiointense physical activity also flags to employers the risks and responsibilities of giving employees free fitness apps and incorporating fitness apps into employee wellness programmes

if the organisation supports fitnessapp use among employees they should also be responsible for ensuring the employee maintains control over their exercise patterns says dr whelan

he suggests organisations could monitor the exerciselog files of employees and assess these for signs of exercise obsession we have had feedback from companies who make health technologies who are keen to figure out ways to develop digital rewards for people when they shouldnt train  either because they are exercising too much they have an injury or they have another important commitment sometimes people become so obsessed with their gym sessions that they cant focus on work assignments says dr whelan

however dr whelan and his coresearcher trevor clohessy from the department of business information systems at galwaymayo institute of technology also acknowledge that further studies with walkers runners triathletes and swimmers using different fitness apps is needed to generalise the findings as their study only looked at cyclists using the strava app ; los angeles feb 14 2020 prnewswire  blaze public relations aâ santa monicabased pr agency specializing in consumer lifestyle brands announced the addition of mayweather boxing  fitness to their growing roster of clients in the health fitness and franchise categories the group fitness and boxing experience created by legendary boxer floyd mayweather formed this partnership to increase brand awareness across the globe

jessie has 15 years of industry experience as a qualified pt and ha changed lives through award winning shows like sky ones obese a year to save my life  sky livings fat the fight of my life

here are jessies top five ways to make sure your fitness changes last a lifetime

1 take action

jessie said many people go from a sedentary state prejanuary to suddenly exercising all the time

this approach often comes with ideas and beliefs that resurface later down the line telling you youre not a person that moves or exercises for example

he added its the excitement that comes at the start of taking on a new fitness regime that will often stimulate the mind to get you moving but once that honeymoon period wears off those old beliefs start to resurface

treat your movement as an action rather than getting into your head and youll start to develop a mentality where the mind follows

2 get away from a rewardsbased mentality

jessie advised instead you should focus on an experienced based mentality so not necessarily treating your movement or goals as a metaphorical finish line as such but focusing more so on how you feel and the overall experience

if were constantly looking for reward eventually reward is going to fall short so weve got to be able to connect to experience 

when you show up for yourself its about thinking about what that feels like if you go for a run outdoors it shouldnt just be about completing that run

the fitness fanatic reminded us to take in the scenery around us the person were running with and how we feel when were doing exercise

3 add meaning to your motion

the exercise guru said if your goals are more vanity driven perhaps about weight loss or looking a certain way try to add more meaning to your motion go beyond the numbers the dress size etc and think about the bigger picture

its thinking about what it means for you to get up and go for that walk or thinking about the commitment youve shown to eating something more nutritious as opposed to always reaching for that guilty pleasure

he added by thinking youll become more aware of the subtle changes that are helping you achieve the superficial goals this will help you become more committed and confident

according to jessie we need to really show up for ourselves more so than just standing on the scales and acknowledging that weve lost five pounds

4 change it up

jessie told us if youve been eating the same foods and doing the same exercise for weeks its not all that uncommon to experience it and that extends to your whole experience look at ways you can make small changes to enhance your routine

that could be as simple as going that bit faster on your run or trying a completely different form of exercise it could be changing the types of foods youre eating

he added with the increased meaning behind your motion you can develop a good understanding as to when it might be time to change things up from an exercise standpoint this will encourage the release of myokines chemicals in the body that make you feel good and help you experience joy

jessie says we should play around and that will keep us accountable and on the right track

5 connect with others

finally the tv fitness star noted even if you workout in isolation most of the time the support of others should not be underestimated

to have a group or person support you on your journey will not only enhance your experience but accountability

by knowing youre supported or vice versa knowing youre in a position where you can support another it will make you more likely to want to show up that day that doesnt just mean getting an exercise partner too

jessie says it can be a friend a family member whoever  everyone has the power to influence positively

he added try and surround yourself with people that you feel comfortable enough and safe around to have an experience again that doesnt need to be limited to exercise it could be as simple as sitting down and having a chat

once you have a network in place then accountability will be enhanced massively the hard bit is about figuring out who those people are and being bold enough to start the conversation

so go out there and keep plugging away at what youre doing using these five tips and youll be on your way to a lifetime of good habits great exercise and a fantastic bod

the goal is to educate and equip young people with the skills and knowledge to incorporate exercise into their daily routine to help improve and maintain both physical and mental health

prof niall moyna dcu who oversees the challenge said over the last eight years the irish life health schools fitness challenge has proven that substantial improvements in cardiovascular fitness can occur after as little as six weeks of regular exercise

a recent study carried out over five weeks where participants took part in low to moderate exercise saw a significant reduction in depression and anxiety

aside from the obvious physical health benefits of physical activity it is proven to also have a positive impact on mental wellbeing

it is vital that we place a greater emphasis on exercise in secondary schools especially as children progress through school when exam and other social pressures increase

marykate slattery law student and amateur boxer hopes that highlighting the longterm health benefits of fitness will encourage secondary school students to take part

i personally struggled with mental health during my early teenage years said ms slattery

i truly realised the power of physical movement as a form of stress release when i started boxing it gives me such relief allows me to express myself and to escape daytoday stresses and overall i feel stronger both physically and mentally

if my story can inspire even one student to get involved in sport or any form of movement i would be delighted

irish life health campaign partner thomas barr said exercising benefits your physical health as well as your mental wellbeing

ive always used my athletics as a break from studying  nothing cleared my head like getting out for a training session with my friends he said

he will be joining the indian team in new zealand ahead of the start of the test series

ishant is extremely happy with the result of the tests and has thanked his nca trainer ashish kaushik who helped him get fit in time ishant took to twitter to express his happiness and tweeted it was a roller coaster ride for me after the injury on my ankle on 20th january but with the help of ashish kaushik i managed to pull it off scans were a little scary but today i am happy that i am fit thanks ashish kaushik

a day after the initial reports of the injury were released ddca director sanjay bhardwaj had said that ishant was most likely to be ruled out of the test series against new zealand as he was advised to rest his legs for at least six weeks

he has been advised complete rest for six weeks so there is little chance of him playing the test series against new zealand next month when he goes to the national cricket academy will depend on his getting into a position where he can walk properly bhardwaj had said

but ishant showed great resolve and determination to get fit in time and will now be available for selection for the first test at wellington beginning on 21 february the lanky pacer has been in good form with the red ball lately and his inclusion is likely to help the visitors put up much stiffer resistance than they would have without him ; the united states government is a massive employer and is always looking for qualified candidates to fill a wide variety of open employment positions in locations across the country below youll find a qualification summary for an active open job listing from the department of the air force the opening is for a recreation aid fitness center in vandenberg afb california feel free to browse this and any other job listings and reach out to us with any questions

in the clip displaying the wrong form lisa did each bicep curl at a quick pace leaning her torso forward with each repetition lisa advised against doing all of this in her caption her video of the correct form showed her curling the weights slowly while maintaining a straight and steady back her caption also recommended keeping the elbow stationary during the exercise she said that doing so forces the activation of the bicep instead of the shoulders the muscles that are inadvertently trained when using the incorrect form she demonstrated

the clip accumulated over 50000 views within the first 45 minutes after it was uploaded in the comments section fans shared their appreciation for lisas demonstration of proper bicep curl form

thank you for these videos one person wrote before adding a hearteye and heart emoji to their comment please keep showing dos and donts

others confessed to seeing people using the improper form that lisa displayed in her video

the one on the left is the huge dudes at the gym with heavy weights a second commenter added

haha i love it a third follower wrote this is a mistake that i see a lot of guys do in the gym

i see so many people doing the one on the left swinging heavier and heavier weights but always with the swing motion a fourth supporter added

a post shared by lisa  workout videos  lisafiitt on feb 16 2020 at 134am pst

this isnt the first time that lisa has used an instagram video to show her 18 million followers the right way to perform an exercise in a previous post she uploaded the same type of video to show them how to properly do glute kickbacks with a cable machine lisas caption on this occasion advised against arching the back while doing the move

keep stability by bracing your core and keep a slight bend in your knee as you push the cable back being careful not to compensate with other muscles make sure you dont go too heavy on this exercise she added

that video has been viewed close to 40000 times since its upload five days ago and more than 500 instagram users have commented on it ; meet sports illustrated swimsuits diverse new stars 56yearold stunner and a bald fitness

far too many adults with disabilities cannot get the exercise they need to live healthy lives simply because gyms do not have the necessary equipment said desaulnier i am proud to sponsor this bill with congressman young to create a bipartisan solution and ensure the promise of the ada is met

according to the centers for disease control and prevention cdc more than 61 million adults in the united states have a disability and are three times more likely to experience serious health problems such as a heart attack or stroke while the cdc recommends 150 minutes a week of moderateintensity aerobic physical activity as a means of reducing these threats no guidelines currently exist for fitness centers to make this exercise possible for individuals with disabilities a 2014 cdc study found that 47 of adults with a disability got no aerobic physical activity with another 22 getting some but not enough

youve probably heard the term fairweather fan it generally refers to a person who supports a sports team only when they are winning its easy to get excited when the conditions are perfect for the win

the same could be said for people who only like to exercise when the weather is ideal not too hot not too cold not too windy and just the right amount of sun

several of my patients have told me they go off track with their exercise routine in the winter its easier to stay in bed when its cold and dark outside

however you can and should continue a fitness routine all yearround  even in the winter

if you are exercising outdoors prepare yourself for the cold temperatures warm up before you leave the house do some dynamic stretches like squats high kicks or pushups to warm up your muscles before the work out

layer up for warmth so you can remove your jacket or sweatshirt if needed runners or cyclists should wear reflective clothing and run or ride with a headlamp it will help you to see whats in front of you and make you more visible to others since it gets dark much earlier remember to stay safe consider exercising with a friend if you are walking running or riding at night

you can also stay healthy at home online workouts or videos can provide a routine that means you dont have to go anywhere to complete it cardiovascular exercise like jumping jacks and running in place along with strength training with hand weights or a band can be done in about 30 minutes several days a week perhaps you prefer to work out at a gym or fitness center they are climate controlled and can provide a safe environment

i tell my patients the best thing they can do for their overall health is to get in small spurts of exercise throughout the day go for several quick walks around the neighborhood or near your office leave your desk and do some yoga or wall squats

cold weather doesnt have to limit you in fact winter weather provides different opportunities for fitness if you are headed to the hills for some winter sports remember to wear a helmet when skiing or snowboarding to help prevent head injuries

your heart lungs arms legs and brain dont take a break in the winter so make sure to continue to give your body all that it needs to thrive even when the temperatures are low discuss your exercise routine with your doctor

heres another reason to keep up your fitness taking time off in the winter could make it more difficult to jumpstart a routine once the weather warms up so its best to stay consistent throughout the year if you do get off track dont beat yourself up any exercise you do to get your heart pumping is a victory that should be celebrated ; leicester manager brendan rodgers has revealed wilfred ndidi may miss the premier league clash with manchester city at the king power stadium next week

the nigerian has missed the draws with wolves and chelsea in recent weeks due to soreness in his knee after he had surgery on his meniscus in january

against wolves on friday hamza choudhury retained his place in defensive midfield due to ndidis injury but received a red card for two bookable offences ruling him out of the next match

speaking in his postmatch press conference as quoted by leicestershire live rodgers said were hopeful well see how that looks hes responded well over the last few days of treatment friday was just too soon for him but hopefully come next week hell be available

if hes not available well have to deal with it wont we well have a look within the squad and see how we can make the change

with ndidi possibly out choudhury suspended and nampalys mendy also injured the foxes may have to face city without a natural defensive midfielder with youri tielemans one candidate to fill the vacant position

james maddison and dennis praet could play ahead of the belgian in a midfield three that has only played together once  during the opening 45 minutes against aston villa in the carabao cup semifinal first leg before choudhury replaced praet at the break

almost two weeks after undergoing surgery last month ndidi returned and made appearances against west ham and aston villa however he was withdrawn from the team to face chelsea an hour before kickoff because he felt soreness in his knee

leicesters topfour bid has stuttered in recent weeks but their hopes of qualifying for the champions league were boosted significantly by the news of citys ban from uefa competitions meaning fifth in the premier league may be good enough to reach europes elite club competition ; new delhi fast bowler ishant sharma has passed his fitness test at the national cricket academy nca and will now join the team in new zealand for the twotest series starting february 21

the 31yearold had suffered an ankle injury during a ranji trophy clash between delhi and vidarbha last month however after rehabilitation at the national cricket academy he has now been cleared to play and provisionally named in the indian squad for the twotest series in new zealand

ishant will fly out on sunday to join the squad in wellington and will join mohammed shami jasprit bumrah umesh yadav and navdeep saini among the speedsters in the squad

while the first test is set to be played from february 21 to 25 the second test is from february 29 to march 4 the indian team is currently playing a threeday warmup game against a new zealand xi side in hamilton ;  train hard fight easy is a quote by alexander suvorov which i stand by put the work in and reap the rewards this is applicable to all aspects of your life  not just fitness

however when it comes to fitness people tend to focus on the obvious cardiovascular endurance and muscular strength but fitness is much more

to be a truly fit person one most focus on all areas there are seven components of fitness  strength endurance speed agility coordination balance and flexibility the one most tend to forget

flexibility is the act of making muscles longer more pliable and increasing their range of motion for a muscle to function efficiently effectively and safely it must be conditioned well you cant pound it and abuse it and expect to remain injuryfree

our bodies are like cars  you cant keep driving it with no maintenance and expect it to still perform at its best

sagicor sigma corporate run is finally here but these stretch tips are for your everyday exercise routine to keep you fit allyear round

1 lay flat on your back on a mat or soft but firm surface

2 ensure tail bone is tucked under and the small of your back is in contact with the floor

3 lift your right leg up towards the ceiling while keeping the left leg planted firmly on the floor

4 try to hold your calf with a straight knee and pull your leg as close to your face as possible if you are unable to reach your leg you can use a belt to assist you

5 while pulling gently on your leg flex your toes towards your face this will intensify the stretch in your calf and hamstring

6 bend you right knee hug it tightly to your chest and lower it to the left side of your body

7 look over your right shoulder while lying in this position this will give you a deep twisting stretch for your lower back

8 always reset and come back to centre or your starting position before moving on

9 remember anything you do on one side must be done on the other  you do not want to be lopsided

10 always exhale when going deeper into your stretch hold each stretch for at least 20 seconds

safety is always number one so ensure to stretch after every physical session you dont always have to be strong you dont always have to be fast but you must always be safe ; pakistan batsman umar akmal has escaped a ban from the pakistan cricket board pcb for allegedly making crude remarks to a trainer during a fitness test at the national cricket academy in lahore the said incident occurred late last month when all the players who hold central and domestic central contracts were directed to take fitness tests at the nca ahead of the home series against bangladesh and the pakistan super league

during the body fat test umar got frustrated after failing the other tests and made some crude remarks to the trainer while undressing the trainer is understood to have reported the matter to misbahulhaq who is head coach and chief selector and he asked the board to hold an inquiry the pcb has said in a statement that after concluding its proceedings into the alleged misconduct by umar during a fitness test and after listening to all the parties involved it was established that the incident happened due to misunderstanding

umar akmal has offered his regrets for his actions and the pcb has reprimanded him and also reminded him about his responsibilities as a senior cricketer the pcb said the matter is now closed and the pcb and umar akmal will offer no further comments the statement concluded

umar who is just 26 last played a test for his country in september 2011 but he has been in and out of the white ball squads his last appearance coming in a t20 international against sri lanka at lahore last october after the board appointed their senior official and former test batsman haroon rasheed as head of the inquiry committee it was expected that umar would be fined and also banned probably from the national oneday cup due after the psl

but the youngest of the akmal brothers apologized and expressed regrets for his reaction during the fitness test and requested the board for leniency umar is no stranger to controversies while continuing to show off his talent at the domestic level including a dashing double hundred in the quaideazam trophy final in karachi in january

if you look at the current indian teams players they are physically very fit as compared to earlier times it is because earlier physical fitness was not given that much importance since t20 format has come cricket has become a physical sport gambhir said at an event in patna bihar

when i started playing cricket there was no t20 cricket it was not a physical sport but was a technical one but if now you are not physically fit i do not think you can do well in any format he added

gambhir also urged girls in the country to take the sport seriously while citing the example of the current indian womens team who were runnerup in the 2017 50over world cup and semifinalists in the 2018 t20 world cup

if girls take up any sport it is a big step towards our vision of making india a sporting country i would want girls to take cricket as seriously as men take it if you look at the current womens team they have played world cup semifinals and before that they have been runner up of the world cup it is a very good sign for the country he said ; fitness trainer lisa lanceford showed fans how to do hip thrusts properly in the latest video on her instagram page dressed in a gray sports bra and matching leggings the brunette beauty displayed proper and improper hipthrust form in a sidebyside comparison video in the clip on the left which displayed the wrong way to do the exercise lisa arched her back when she got to the top of the movement and lifted her head a mistake she said was common among gymgoers

in the clip on the right lisa kept her spine in line with her hips as she thrust her pelvis upward she also looked straight ahead during the exercise in her caption lisa noted that one needs to drive the heels down to start the motion and the glutes should be tightened after the hips have been lifted

the clip racked up close to 40000 views within the first halfhour after it was uploaded in the comments section fans shared their appreciation for the video

amid all of the compliments other commenters had questions one instagram user asked for suggestions for how their back can feel more comfortable while positioned on the bench lisa said that she couldnt give her specific recommendations because she couldnt see how theyre doing the exercise but said that using an incline bench might help

bianca engaged with her dedicated followers by replying to some of the comments

as fans are aware this is far from the first time that the model has shown off her incredible figure on social media in fact a majority of her instagram posts consist of her wearing revealing outfits that leave little to the imagination ; a truth about the maldives that never seems to make it into holiday brochures it rains there and heavily and while there remains a degree of regularity to the rainy season climate change has meant it can no longer be predicted with certainty

those downpours dont fit easily within a stereotypical honeymoon itinerary but it turns out they can be beneficial if youre visiting for a keepfit holiday during my stay i frequently gave thanks for the buckets of cooling water that drenched me on sunrise jogs around the st regis maldives vommuli resort admittedly it was one of the easier exercises i was tasked with while completing an intense programme overseen by celebrity fitness trainer matt roberts but given the maldives yearround warm temperatures and humidity these rain showers  as opposed to the ones in the villas bigasabus bathrooms  proved helpful nonetheless

the first and most highprofile of a series of specialist trainers and fitness experts enlisted to take up temporary residency at the resort matt was showing us that the maldives has much more to offer than romance though it does supply that in spades and that keepfit advocates and fanatics will find all that they need to holiday healthily and indulgently at the st regis

its a fair claim given the st regis is unquestionably one of the bestequipped resorts in the country and undoubtedly among the most beautiful i fell head over heels for the design by singapore and londonbased wow architects inspired by maldivian lagoon life its main buildings are subtly shaped to mimic the countrys sea life from a sleek semicylindrical bar that takes the shape of a whale shark to sprawling overwater villas that resemble manta rays

i became wellacquainted with the spa where massages were administered daily by kind capable therapists who knew wed been put through our paces by matt and needed properly restorative treatments rather than mollycoddling the building appears from overhead to be a lobster its long body providing the relaxation area and pool and the pods that form its pinchers serving as the treatment rooms

i had expected that matt would have planned a fairly easy schedule for us  guests at resorts like this arent necessarily accustomed to taking orders or physically strenuous work  but that wasnt the case we were pushed to our limits every day with a variety of cardio and strengthtraining exercises supplemented by antigravity and conventional yoga sessions

tough though he was matt was a convincing encouraging and highly knowledgeable ambassador radiating good health the 46yearold is militant about sticking to his fitness regime  he exercises for between seven and 10 hours per week and drinks alcohol sparingly between two and three times a week  but reassured us that incorporating exercise and healthy eating habits into our own lives neednt be too much of a hardship we were told that our own exercise sessions neednt surpass 30 to 40 minutes in duration and that we should aim for three sessions a week if we only wanted to maintain our physique and general level of fitness more than that if we wanted to see improvements

of course we had signed up for results and had only four days in which to get them so that meant the pressure was on we often exercised for three hours per day pursuing interval training and weight training alongside the aforementioned early morning jogs and yoga sessions our most pleasurable pursuit a rest activity of sorts was a matt robertsapproved snorkelling session occasionally competitive classes amped up our motivation too with matt sometimes coopting the resorts palmfringed outdoors tennis court and devising games in which we would challenge one another

those goodnatured bouts revived memories of games i used to play with neighbours as a child but matts approach to fitnessretreat nutrition was fairly new to me despite its simplicity while most luxury health resorts and spas restrict the menus and foodstuffs to which guests have access matt instead encouraged us to order from the resorts main menus but governed us in how to do so in a healthier way

while the most obvious excesses were still out of bounds to us  i had to resist the piles of cakes and pastries so teasingly displayed as part of the superb breakfast buffet  we were encouraged to simply think cleverly about how dishes would support our fitness objectives and reminded that welltrained restaurant staff the world over are now accustomed to answering questions about dishes compositions we werent to assume they wouldnt be able or willing to guide us

that turned out to be true with the waiter at international restaurant alba advising me that the mild coconutcream soup wasnt in fact too creamy and was permitted laden with chicken mushrooms and lemongrass it was properly delicious eating fresh sashimi or the likes of grilled maldivian yellowfin tuna with steamed veg and couscous was also no hardship and we were even allowed a fullon finedining experience with wine at waterside asian restaurant orientale that included biryani black rice with cornfed chicken and spinach lamb with jerusalem artichokes butternut squash and truffle jus and gluten and dairyfree dark chocolate cake with almond ganache raspberry sorbet and fresh berries matt tucked in to every course too

that recalibration of how i can continue to dine indulgently while attempting to stay fit on holiday has really helped me on the trips ive taken subsequently i found it far more useful than being given a preapproved menu and consuming the food unwittingly the same goes for matts approach to incorporating exercise into my itinerary  im now a bit better at completing a workout before breakfast and then getting on with my day less guiltily that our quickfire bootcamp break also generated real results  i was noticeably more toned within just a few days  has also encouraged me

following in matts wake other health practitioners to take up residency at st regis maldives vommuli will include olivia weil who will lead workshops throughout march more sentimentality minded than matt her focus is on the emotional weight we carry and how it can be shed to unleash our full potential  expect to hear talk of chakras auras and soul retrieval instead of demands to do press ups and burpees for the month of april sandra laznik will combine yoga pilates and massage to provide tailored rejuvenating treatments for guests who are tackling struggles both spiritual and physical

their varied approaches should resonate with audiences who may have dismissed the maldives as somewhere targeting honeymooners only and their respective programmes promise to be sufficiently varied and considered to keep guests engaged and happy even if its raining

a woman of many talents whether shes cohosting her hit tv one daytime talk show sister circle or performing on stage while promoting her new album woman whatever she sets her mind to syleena johnson is sure to succeed in these days her latest venture that shes had success with is fitness competitions

the 43yearold recently transformed a longtime goal she had to possibly hit the stage and flex her muscles in a fitness competition and made it a reality she trained for eight months and took her fans along for the ride with a docuseries on her social media called from 1 stage 2 the next by the time she was ready to make her debut in december for the npc texas cup she was 50 pounds lighter ripped and full of confidence she would walk away from her very first competition in the womens figure category with three awards

we spoke with renaissance woman johnson about fitting her fitness journey into a packed schedule the stern dietary changes she had to make to be ready for the big day and why taping herself and sharing those videos with fans during her training ultimately helped her reach her goal

madamenoire im very intrigued by your work in the fitness competition realm i know you just got into it what was the inspiration for you to see that goal through from start to finish

syleena johnson ive always wanted to bodybuild for two decades even and i just never got around to it something was like this is the moment this is the time so i documented it and i created a documentary called from one stage to the next it shows you well it shows me going through all of the different things i had to go through to be able to get to the fitness stage in the midst of performing on the singing stage and also being a talk show host on that stage i was just kind of bouncing around from stage to stage to stage in my life there is always the mom and wife stage there are all these different stages in your life you have to perform on so we created a documentary following all that we started last may recording it took me eight months to get in shape for the fitness competition i had to drop over fiftysomething pounds the motivation was just to be able to do something ive always wanted to do i just didnt want to be 80 years old like man i wish i would have done it

on your journey what were some of the hardest habits to break

oh my god cheese and wine those two were it right there cheese and wine and not getting enough sleep sleep is very very important when youre training and its hard to find that extra sleep

can you take us to the day of the competition and how you were feeling you were very successful for your first outing

it was surreal i had to take off work for three days before the competition so that i could rest completely i did nothing but lay in the bed with my legs up because thats actually when the muscle happens the muscle builds when you rest and so i did nothing but lay in the bed and eat fish and asparagus six times a day i was super super sick of that but it was exciting i couldnt wait to show the competition what i had learned and i couldnt wait to learn myself and see the other packages the women had brought to the stage it was just fun it was really fun i cant wait to be back in that same shape and that same mindset im supposed to be training for one right now but this woman tour and the press its a lot so i may have to push it up to give myself real time

i was going to ask you if you were training to do it again you may need a break

this one is april 11 but i think thats too soon i think im going to have to push it based on the fact that im not getting the rest i need right now im swelling right now which is counterproductive

but that being said are you at least able to keep up the healthy eating habits and diet you acquired

for the most part because i have a chef when im at home i have meal prep on the road though its much harder

did sharing your journey through the documentary and on social media help to hold you accountable and aid you in being successful

yes absolutely it took two months for me to even talk about it i trained for two months and had dropped the first 25 pounds before i even said anything about it i knew that people wouldnt believe me even my closest friends i knew they wouldnt believe me because people say theyre going to do stuff all of the time but something that strenuous and tumultuous thats something where people have to see you doing it so it was just me following my dreams following through with it and doing it i needed to tell everyone because the accountability for me was one thing but then the accountability for all of us all black women who are watching sister circle every day and me sitting up there talking about it but at the end of the day im not in my best shape thats hypocritical so i wanted to show them i could do it with them and we can all do it too together ; fitness classes can be motivating in a way that exercising by yourself is not somebodys pushing you to go the distance to do that next rep and with luck theyll drown out the part of your brain thats tempting you to go home and have dinner already

the lifehacker staff tried out several of the apps that promise a classlike workout from the convenience of your phone with mixed results heres how that went and which ones we recommend

i tried a peloton workout on an exercise bike at the gym i am not a fan of cardio but its necessary to be a healthy person or something so i hear so ive begun tacking a quick bike or rower workout onto the end of a few of my lifting sessions

the peloton app available on android ios and fire tv 1299month after the free trial puts the camera on an instructor who peptalks you through an interval workout i chose a 15minute tabata ride and found it to be very similar to the cyclebar classes ive taken in the past the instructor was just the right mix of peppy and serious and the music was well chosen the only annoying thing is that she referenced specific peloton resistance settings urging us to get up to 55 for a certain interval for example which had no relation to anything on my gym bike

besides bike rides the app also has routines for other types of equipment and for home workouts

our video producer joel kahn was familiar with actual peloton bikes so i asked him to try out studiolive available ios 1499month after the free trial to compare he did a treadmill workout and reported back

the actual routines seemed pretty close to an inperson class however it was hard to keep up with the poor audio at points certainly having an instructor there to tell you if you are doing something properly is an advantage there are also no onscreen prompts letting you know the speed or incline you should be doing at a given moment so if you miss what the instructor just said then you have a full minute of walking when you should be running i do think its better than doing it on my own but i would rather try another app to find a better interface before incorporating it into my routine

our podcast producer micaela heck likes to run outdoors so i sent her out to try a guided run with nike run club free on ios and android an app that i myself love if im stuck on a treadmill the interval routine called run fast repeat is a personal favorite this one provides audio workouts only no videos

micaela tried the runs labeled first long run and second long run and had this to say

coach barrett has a nice voice and he provides just the right level of encouragement without being cheesy or overthetop his conversational tone also does sort of make you feel like youre not alone on your run i also found that having someone talk to me while i run made me pace myself a little better

i dont know that i would go to a class or seek coaching for running anyway personally but i do think this is a very cheap free way to amp up your running game without having to seek out a coach or a running club there are so many guided run options i cant imagine youd run out of them very quickly

i think it would be helpful for days when my motivation is lacking but i probably wont use it regularly as im someone who enjoys simply zoning out to music while i run

our food and beverage editor claire lower wanted a workout she could do without leaving home so i asked her to try aaptiv available on ios or android 999month after the free trial and she chose a 10minute core workout aaptiv doesnt have builtin videos either which turned out to be a downside for this type of workout heres what she said

i do not like the aaptiv app at all for one you cannot see anyone doing the moves while youre working out you have to watch the move in a different screen which i find disruptive also i do not like the music and it turns out i do not like people speaking to me in a loud motivational voice i will continue to watch short demonstration videos and gifs at home and ask the old men at the gym if im doing this right

for what its worth the cardio workouts seem like they would work a lot better in this format and you can listen to sample clips on the aaptiv website ; photo shutterstock

strava which tracks the sports activity trends of some 50 million people in almost 200 countries surveyed 25000 runners and found that half of them say they either hate it or barely tolerate it while only 8 love it

but running is often connected with a sense of stability at a deeper level strava said in a report of the surveys findings runners described the need to run to maintain their sense of self and as a way to respond to adversity

theres a great realisation that to exercise the body also helps to exercise the mind  which is a muscle that needs just as much looking after as the other muscles said simon klima stravas global marketing director

and love it or hate it the vast majority of runners cited health as a primary motivator for getting out and clocking up the miles more than 80 said they started running to get healthier stronger or have more energy

in brazil 22 of amateur runners said theyd taken up the sport due to a health scare that compares with just 2 in the united states there almost half of respondents said building strength was a core motivator to run  and this was even higher  at 54  among us women

german runners were the most likely of the nations surveyed to cite body image as a reason to run  at 47  and in japan 15 say they run to combat feelings of anxiety and depression

klima sees this as a sign of the times with social media networks putting pressure on people for how they look its driving up the motivating factor of body image he said

the why we run survey  which included respondents from nine countries in north america south america asia and europe  showed how runners worldwide share many common traits

it clustered runners into five key types based on the benefits they value and the extent to which they race or run in social groups

they ranged from passionate runners who run in many social settings and reap the psychosocial benefits like accomplishment and happiness to mindful runners  who tend to run alone  to reluctant runners who rarely compete in races and perceive the fewest social or psychological benefits of all runner types

henshaw was forced off with a head injury after 45minutes of irelands convincing victory over wales in round two of the guinness six nations

however he has come through the return to play protocols and is in contention to start against england

yeah im fully recovered henshaw said as his team seek revenge for last seasons 3220 defeat in dublin

i passed all the protocols it was really frustrating to come off but the doctors have a job to do and if they see something they have to be cautious and take player safety into account

garry ringroses broken finger gave henshaw his opportunity at outside centre against wales but the 26yearold leinster back was himself forced off after a collision with dan biggar

however his absence made little difference to an ireland team who went on to win 2414 against wayne pivacs newlook wales team

he added it was disappointing not to get back on but you have to go with it i was enjoying myself and it was great to be back in the aviva in a great atmosphere it wasnt ideal for me but the team did an excellent job finishing it off

ireland are preparing to return to the scene of their 2018 grand slam and can also clinch the triple crown with victory at twickenham after winning both of their two opening games under new coach andy farrell henshaw insists however that a significant challenge awaits them

were aware of the challenge going to twickenham it is a hostile environment said the centre

but we went there two years ago with our backs to the wall and a grand slam on the line so we know we can produce big performances

despite victory two years ago and englands loss to france in round one henshaw is keen to avoid complacency in the ireland camp

he said winning a triple crown is not at the forefront of our minds it is about focusing on our performance twickenham is a cauldron they are tough opposition and a tough crowd

were under no illusions that it is a tough place to play its down to us to play as well as we can our defence will have to be rock solid thats our focus today and then we will work on our attack

ireland have been boosted by the return of no8 caelan doris who was forced off after only four minutes of his test debut against scotland two weeks ago and henshaw is confident that there is sufficient quality in the squad to compete with eddie jones intense england team

he added across the group we know we have big players who can produce big moments jordan larmour is one who can do that as he showed against wales but its up to all of us to try and produce those big moments ; australian fitness trainer kayla itsines tantalized her 122 million instagram followers with a closeup shot of her chiselled abs the picture was one of the three slides in her latest instagram update which was all about core training and working on her abs after giving birth

after the win against wrexham last time out midfielder curtis weston said training was the biggest change that had taken place since pemberton came in at the start of january

pemberton who has introduced gps trackers a sports scientist and psychology sessions said i do not think for a minute that they were not fit they just were not sharp

it is just being able to compete at an intensity and be able to repeat the intensity of the work i think that is what they were struggling with

that is one of the things that as staff we have addressed quickly

they do work hard in training and i have to say the training ground is not in the best condition so they do work probably harder than they should because of the state of the training area because of the weather

i certainly think you cant say they are not fit enough because you do not score in the last minute against wrexham if you are not fit

rebecca brown rn acos kindred hospital

i have trailblazers in my family says rebecca brown rn aunt cookie was the first nurse in my family and was my mentor

browns sister janet and sadie blackman then a nurse at st margarets in hammond now a part of franciscan health also inspired her to be a nurse

brown was in the helping profession when she went back to school at purdue university calumet in 1991  then transferred to south suburban college in south holland working full time it took her 10 years to get her rn i had some barriers but thats ok i tell people dont you ever quit 

brown had a 315 grade point average and i was so godly proud of what the lord was doing for me

her training was at st catherines hospital in east chicago and she received her rn license at kindred hospital where shes worked for 17 years now 64 her continued dedication is one reason for being selected as a top nurse in the region

a few months ago a family she knew needed help with a patient at home being fed intravenously if people call me and i can get there im coming to see them

a licensed missionary at true vine church of god in christ in east chicago brown says her faith informs her work

i pray with the patients family i ask the lord for strength and guidance and to give me what to say i dont force myself on people most of all im there for them medically

she would get up at 4 am before work to tend to a nephews family member in hospice care at home i decided she needed that care more often than the home nurse was able to come to the house

when a patient isnt going to make it i try to be a pillar of strength knowing the patient is about to make that transition to pass away ill pray with the family sometimes just your presence helps

browns cousin angela davis who nominated her recalls a time of worry and anguish about a year ago her mother was a patient of browns and it became clear her mother wasnt going to survive words cannot express how much care and love becky gave not only my mom but our family becky comforted me prayed for me held me she gave more courage and strength

my mother passed away but i know she was loved and cared for by becky  with compassion love and diligence

to recharge after so much care says brown i pray read my bible ask the lord to help me be a light and a humble servant

and she relies on the support of her husband children and church family she adds with a laugh i do like shopping lord help me i like shoes and boots and i like to travel

now her younger sister is catching the inspiration pursuing a nursing degree

says davis if you look up the definition of a nurse beckys picture should be there

carol burns rn bsn st mary medical center

a nurse for 40 years carol burns has served as a mentor to the nurses she has worked with always available to answer a question talk through patient care teach new techniques and lend support

yet not once has she stopped learning she may be considered a teacher to many at st mary medical center especially nurses learning the ropes as they begin their careers but she considers herself a student of her profession always willing to learn new techniques as a surgical nurse so that patients receive the best care

everything is always changing in surgical care burns said nursing is a very actively changing career different medications ways to treat things youre always learning your mind is never not learning

in addition to being a team player she was a team leader for several years serving as a charge nurse in the surgical department at st mary before beginning her career at what used to be st marys mercy hospital in gary burns working in nursing homes and as a nurses aide during high school

it was then that she realized she wanted to spend her career helping people

it was rewarding the valparaiso resident said there were people who didnt have family and you could help make them feel better

but rather than work in a chronic care setting she preferred acute care and ultimately chose to become a surgical nurse

over time you see patients come in and out but youre doing something where you can make them feel better right away burns said

each day is different whether its caring for patients who are having open heart surgery or those have gallbladder surgery

but one thing remains the same  her dedication to improving the lives of patients many of whom are experiencing the worst moment of their lives

she works very hard and has been on call for more nights and weekends than i can count says her daughter kris burns she refuses to leave the hospital position to work at a small doctors office or clinic because she loves helping people especially in emergency surgery situations

burns sister marlyce farabaugh says its that dedication that makes her the goto person in surgery at the hospital

carol is a great example of medical care at its best she said the surgical staff are not the only ones who depend on her the surgical physicians do as well because she has worked with so many of them over the years and contributes so much toward the success of their surgeries

going above and beyond not only for her coworkers and patients but her family as well has created truly an angel here on earth farabaugh said

she exemplifies the best in nursing due to her knowledge and abilities along with the empathy and care for others she has always shown she said

at 62 burns says she plans to care for patients for another three to four years

its a very active job and its hard on your body because we lift we move we run she said as long as i can do it though im going to continue its a good job and very rewarding

debra deboer rn ccmfranciscan health dyer

debra deboer remembers telling her kindergarten teacher that she would be a nurse when she grew up she seemed destined to go into the health care field it was her calling

she joined the future nurses club at illiana christian high school and went to evangelical school of nursing right after graduation four decades later she is still doing the tough job of caring for patients but also cherishing the opportunity to make a difference in someones life

for these reasons deboer has been selected as a top nurse in the region

deboer is the emergency department case manager at franciscan health dyer she started there right out of nursing school 40 years ago when the hospital was known as our lady of mercy hospital

during her four decades at the hospital she has worked in several roles including wound care home care emergency room nurse and sexual assault nurse examiner she has been in case management for 15 years nursing gives you a lot of opportunities in a lot of different directions all within the same building said deboer

being able to help people at all levels of care is what deboer likes best about nursing i think its about being able to help people at all levels of care whether its a phone call from a friend asking you to look at a sons cut or splinter to seeing people on the worst day of their lives and walking them through that in the er she said

being a nurse is more a way of life than a profession to deboer i think its more of who you are and not what you do i think nurses think differently than other folks do she said i laugh when someone says they are a retired nurse because theres no such thing

the job is also very much about teaching and deboer said it can be a challenge to teach people how to take care of themselves in language that they can understand

she has sacrificed time with her family to care for other families working as an rn and case manager with franciscan health for the bulk of that time each day she has worked selflessly for the betterment of her patients their families and her fellow nurses and doctors said her daughter dana smith there were so many times she came home from her shift and has cried for and prayed for her patients her heart is for nursing her family and her world and my heart is warmed and encouraged by her every day

deboer has been married for 40 years and is a mother of two and grandmother of five

debbie goes above and beyond for her patients said her coworker brandy hawkins she worked a whole year solo in her department working long days and nights to ensure her patients needs were met shes totally awesome

cindy fultz rncmnn porter regional hospital

each day is a novelty shaped by unique circumstances unexpected challenges and new faces that come with providing maternity care services for veteran porter regional hospital nurse cindy fultz

every day is so different from the one before and its so rejuvenating to come back each day to a new day she says as an ob nurse much of the novelty comes from the joy of nurturing new lives and families but many days bring difficulties too the trials have shaped fultz as much as the celebrations have if you have only easy days youre not going to be a good nurse

fultz is living out graceful excellence refined through trial as she cares for patients while undergoing treatment for breast cancer a small tumor was discovered during a routine mammogram in october 2018 she underwent a lumpectomy followed by chemotherapy sessions slated to be followed by radiation her cancer was caught early and her prognosis is good but chemotherapy often led to complications and exhaustion nonetheless fultz continued to work throughout much of her treatment

coworker and fellow nurse alex linz recalls fultzs professionalism and kindness during her nursing orientation three years ago i always heard how nurses eat their young but not cindy she was kind to me taught me everything she knew and gave me so much reassurance and confidence

linz is amazed and encouraged by how fultzs professionalism and care continued undeterred throughout her cancer treatment this year has been a rough one for cindy but she still comes to work in between chemo treatments with that same beautiful smile she is going through the most difficult time of her life and yet still manages to make each new mom feel special and loved she answers every paranoid new parents questions and holds every baby with compassion and care she is a remarkable human being and the best nurse i know

fultz says that her aunt doris inspired her to be become a nurse she recalls getting her tonsils out as a child at ross clinic where doris worked as a nurse while in recovery fultz was awed when doris walked out in full uniform with a bag of safety suckers i always looked up to my aunt doris shes the kindest most generous and most intelligent person ive ever known and when i saw that i thought thats exactly what i want to do

she started her nursing career as a medicalsurgical nurse but it was her experience as a mother that inspired her to be an obstetrics nurse fultz says it was the most wonderful time in my life and i wanted to be a part of that in other peoples lives its a great fit and ive never looked back fultz has spent 26 of the past 34 years of her nursing career in obstetrics and has worked at porter regional hospital for the last 17 years its such a privilege to be around when mothers are having their babies

privileged is also how fultz describes herself in regard to her husband jesse and three grown children alyssa jennifer and natalie her children inspired her to become an obstetrics nurse and her husband provides the continual support and encouragement necessary for nursing i couldnt be the nurse i am without jesse she says

fultzs experience as a cancer treatment patient has deepened the compassion she brings to her job each day my experience with cancer has been scary being a patient reminded me that my job may be routine but the experience isnt routine to the patient i think its good for everybody who gives care to receive care im grateful for the refreshed compassion my experience brought me

ana bran guzman bsn rn cbpn st mary medical center

even in elementary school ana bran guzman knew she wanted to help people by being in the medical field

she has achieved those goals and done it so well that she has been recognized as one of the top nurses in the region

i was the third of four children and i was always taking care of my siblings guzman said when i was in high school i wanted to be a radiology technician and i started out to be that but i missed the deadline to apply nursing was the second option and i was accepted into that program right away at indiana university in 1994

after graduation she started in the medical surgical unit but as she gained more skills she moved into other areas this occurred every three to six years first at st catherine hospital in east chicago and since 2012 at st mary medical center in hobart

ive always been lucky that every specialty ive been involved in has opened the door to do more she said

her progression in her 20 years in nursing saw her go from medsurg to sameday surgery and recovery and then the gastrointestinal lab when radiology needed a nurse she snagged the position

as the hospitals first radiology nurse she become a breast navigator serving as a liaison and advocate for breast cancer patients

when the patient comes in with lumps we get them ready for a biopsy and work with them to relieve their anxiety people have a fear of the word cancer we want them to know they are not alone and we make the appointment to see a surgeon or a medical oncologist

throughout the years ive been encouraged to go to seminars to be familiar with the new technology we used to have to do additional imaging and other tests that would take a week or more now we can get sameday reports if there isnt a problem a day or two if there is a lump

guzman said she gives the patients her phone number and tells them to call or text her at any time with concerns they might have married for 10 years she and her husband roy have two children

though she said she didnt know she was nominated to be a top nurse until she saw it on social media patients told her they voted for her

she similarly got plenty of support from coworkers including donna fiatak ana is an amazing compassionate nurse fiatak wrote in nominating guzman she works closely with our patients who have breast biopsies and works closely with them when they are diagnosed with breast cancer patients are scared and at times do not know what is going to happen next she guides them through the process and is there for her patients they are never alone her coworkers and physicians have the utmost respect for her

alexander serrano rn bsn franciscan health

for alexander serrano nursing is more of a calling than a profession

i stumbled upon the nursing field through an event that happened my junior year of high school i remember i was walking down the hallway and not too far ahead from me i witnessed another student fall to the ground and start to have a seizure serrano says

i remember wanting to help but feeling frozen because i had no idea what to do  from that day forward i was inspired to pursue a career that would give me the skills and knowledge to act quickly and help out in those situations

serrano has been working for franciscan health since 2015 when he started as a nurse on a medical floor and then became a fulltime nurse in the emergency department

tina partain nurse supervisor at franciscans hammond munster and dyer campuses says serranos willingness to help out is extraordinary

he works every floor hes an er nurse but hell work rehab anywhere in the hospital a lot of nurses would say thats not my practice im not comfortable with that a lot of people just dont like to float in general but hes all about it and he still likes his job she says

according to serrano the hardest thing about nursing and the most rewarding are very closely related

its difficult working with someone when they are at their most vulnerable state he says however its equally rewarding being a part of a patients journey through illness and wellness  you are trusted to provide comfort compassion and security to someone during their uncertain moments in life serrano says

serrano says the secret to his success as a nurse and as a team player is his love of learning which goes back to his experiences at munster high school from which he graduated in 2011

that move to munster highly influenced who i am today by surrounding me with great teachers who guided me through high school and prepared me for college serrano says socializing with my peers who all had different cultures and backgrounds also expanded my values and appreciation of life

partain says serranos also is gifted with the ability to help agitated patients

he doesnt talk back hes just really compassionate she says he really talks to the patient and usually he reels them in you know he brings them back to his level

serranos nursing philosophy reveals some of the reasons his approach is so effective an approach that has led him to be recognized as a top nurse in the region

the most important thing you can do for a patient is to be empathetic and listen he says i believe this sets the foundation needed for a patient to be receptive to their treatment and patient education needed to better their health

if you can show a patient early on that you value their input and feelings it can make a world of difference

geri smith rn bsn franciscan health

helping others is in geri smiths blood

the griffith woman has been involved in nursing for about 40 years and her attraction to the field started at a young age

while growing up in chicago smiths mother was a nurse

i remember seeing her dressing up in her whites and going to work smith said of her mom

because of her strong connection to nursing smith knew exactly what she wanted to bring to school one day for a showandtell session

she chuckled as she explained how she brought in a syringe with a needle that she wanted to show her classmates

smiths teacher at the time was quick to take the item away for safe keeping the moment smith was about to present it to the class

the showandtell incident may have ended differently than smith expected but it didnt diminish her attraction to nursing

smith received her bachelors degree in nursing in 1982 but it wasnt too long before she decided she wanted to go back to school for more specialized medical training

smith said it was a few years later when she noticed there was a need for wound ostomy and continence nurses

she said patients needed to learn how to take care of themselves but many werent receiving the instruction they needed at that time

smith became an advanced practice wound ostomy and continence nurse more than 30 years ago so she could provide greater assistance to her patients

smith said she enjoys teaching others and she gets to do that as a nurse in her specialized field she also is able to help others when its greatly needed

i like to put the patient back in patientcare said smith who works for franciscan health

not only has smith helped teach patients how to take care of themselves she also has trained and educated many nurses throughout the region said michelle rivera a coworker of smiths

she is kind sweet and helpful to all that she meets including patients coworkers family and friends rivera said she is my inspiration as a wound care nurse

in the wound ostomy and continence field smith will look at all the things people dont want to look at but she isnt bothered by that

she knows shes around to take care of whatever they need she said of her patients

smith said many of the procedures her patients need are painful and it is her job to get her minds off the pain

she does so by entering her patients rooms with a smile and using humor to help put them at ease when they are struggling

it just seems to help smith said

many have noticed how dedicated smith is to her patients

she is genuinely concerned for the welfare of her patients and the patients families providing compassionate empathetic selfless care said melissa romeo another coworker of smiths geri has many times assisted patients and their familys needs such as receiving assistance with obtaining supplies and care additional education and addressing areas of concern

ashleigh warburton rn bsn ccrncmc methodist hospitals

though she knew at an early age that she wanted a career that allowed her to help people ashleigh warburton wasnt sure what that would be like many nurses however she found inspiration in the joys and challenges of the profession as reflected in some of those closest to her

my mother and grandmother are both nurses and they really inspired me to follow in their footsteps warburton says it turned out to be one of the best decisions ive ever made

that decision has taken warburton to the intensive care unit at methodist hospitals a particularly challenging environment for any caregiver where patients face long difficult roads to recovery and the news for anxious family members is not always positive the icu in other words demands a brand of care and resilience that not everyone is built to handle but warburton feels it encompasses everything that drew her to nursing in the first place

it can be a challenge to find the right words to comfort patients and family members during their most difficult and saddest times she says of her work in the icu but its also great to be able to use my critical thinking multitasking and prioritization skills to collaborate with the doctors to find solutions to the complex and lifethreatening problems that these patients are facing because when we can work together to provide the best possible patient outcomes the reward is an immense and profound feeling of accomplishment and pride its so rewarding to see a patient walk out of the hospital healed and living a healthier life

warburtons standout effort in the icu has not gone unnoticed as evidenced not only by her 2018 nursing excellence award at methodist hospitals and this recognition as a top nurse in the region but also the daily admiration of her fellow nurses and superiors

ashleigh is a truly exceptional nurse who always ensures that her patients receive the very best care at all times says methodist nursing director sheila pochran she continually looks for opportunities for new ways to improve the quality and safety of the care her patients receive and is involved in many process improvement plans throughout the organization ashleigh is highly respected by staff physicians and leadership within the organization and we are truly blessed to have her as part of the methodist team

warburton looks forward to advancing her nursing career having recently applied to a doctorate of nursing practice program with a family nurse practitioner specialty but even as that next potential step of her journey begins to unfold shell continue to focus on the goal that brought her to nursing in the first place  helping people every day

i am really proud of the nurse i have become she says i feel confident in my skills as an icu nurse and i am ready and eager to take on any challenge my nursing career can throw at me

after eight years all taxis buses and truck owners should renew it once in 12 months there are 122 lakh commercial vehicles in tn now

though the union road transport ministry had proposed the change in 2018 tamil nadu delayed it and is one of the last states to adopt it on february 13 the state transport commissioner had written to national infomatic centre nic to make suitable changes in vahan governments online vehicle registration portal

this move has attracted mixed responses while automobile experts have called the move unwarranted citing safety concerns transporters have welcomed it as it reduces their expenditure

data suggests most tn trucks transporting construction materials consumer goods and industry raw materials run at least 75000km to 100000km every year

by default wear and tear at the space between engine piston and cylinder is high in highway vehicles and their piston rings get damaged frequently most vehicle owners adopt unscientific stopgap techniques to continue operations and fix them only during fc renewal said s suresh kumar automobile engineering professor from ssn engineering college chennai

in case of taxis operational within city limits damage will be more along brake linings and clutch plates as brakes are frequently applied so it is better to stick to the present rule allowing frequent vehicle inspection he said

c dhanraj secretary of state lorry owners federation said repairs are fixed every now and then and only painting and refurbishing works take place before fc renewal

the new rule will help us in saving rs 50000 per truck every year moreover it was applicable only to newer vehicles in which wear and tear is less he said thereby rejecting claims that safety was compromised

but accident data suggests that newer vehicles were involved in more accidents compared to older ones those less than five years of age caused 38 of the total 63900 accidents reported in tn in 2018

referring to this a regional transport officer in chennai said the change should exempt at least government buses for which fcs are renewed once in six months now because of the usage ; birmingham england feb 17 2020 prnewswire â after becoming the uks number one cbd brand in 2019 vitality cbd have hit the ground running this year with the launch of their innovative active cbd range covering four different cbd oils and a muscle rub active is set to revolutionise the uk fitness sector

its not going to be an easy one shes coming back from a long injury but with the level shes at shes quite up there in terms of her importance and recovery

whether there is still a drive whether im good enough whether im fit enough and whether i deserve my spot in the side if i can tick all those then definitely 2023 is an option

the bighitting batsman said despite his desire to continue he wont put himself under too much pressure

you always want to do well and first and foremost the game is more important at the same time you can put extra pressure on yourself youve just got to go out and enjoy it and take it as another game hopefully i can contribute in any way i can he said

taylor will be joining stephen fleming daniel vettori and brendon mccullum in the new zealand test 100club and he credited his mentor the late martin crowe for motivating him

he crowe saw something in me that i never did i was pretty happy to play one test to play 100 tests is pretty special he said

updated date feb 18 2020 112509 ist ; many proteins that are incapable of refolding in vitro nevertheless fold efficiently to their native state in the cell this suggests that more information than the amino acid sequence is required to properly fold these proteins here we show that synonymous mrna mutations can alter a protein folding mechanism in vivo leading to changes in cellular fitness this work demonstrates that synonymous codon selection can play an important role in supporting efficient protein production in vivo

in the cell proteins are synthesized from n to c terminus and begin to fold during translation cotranslational folding mechanisms are therefore linked to elongation rate which varies as a function of synonymous codon usage however synonymous codon substitutions can affect many distinct cellular processes which has complicated attempts to deconvolve the extent to which synonymous codon usage can promote or frustrate proper protein folding in vivo although previous studies have shown that some synonymous changes can lead to different final structures other substitutions will likely be more subtle perturbing predominantly the protein folding pathway without radically altering the final structure here we show that synonymous codon substitutions encoding a single essential enzyme lead to dramatically slower cell growth these mutations do not prevent active enzyme formation instead they predominantly alter the protein folding mechanism leading to enhanced degradation in vivo these results support a model in which synonymous codon substitutions can impair cell fitness by significantly perturbing cotranslational protein folding mechanisms despite the chaperoning provided by the cellular protein homeostasis network ; sioux falls sd kelo  boutique fitness studios have been becoming more and more popular recently and theres actually quite a few of them here in keloland

celtic are sweating on the fitness of two defenders ahead of thursdays europa league last 32 clash away to fc copenhagen

as reported by the daily record neil lennon is hopeful that he will have jozo simunovic back for the game after he missed sundays trip to aberdeen due to a hamstring problem with the croatians fitness to be assessed prior to the match in denmark

the daily record added that greg taylor also faces a race against time to be fit for thursday after he limped off with a suspected hamstring injury at pittodrie at the weekend

simunovics absence would be very disappointing for him on a personal level having recently reestablished himself in the side after missing five months due to a knee injury that required a surgical cleanout as per the telegraph

however his omission from the team is one that celtic should be able to absorb without too much hassle given that they topped their europa league group without him and have two centrebacks in christopher jullien and kristoffer ajer who have popped up with goalscoring contributions of late lennon also has the option of putting nir bitton at centreback just as he did against aberdeen

the possible absence of taylor could be a discernible blow to the hoops though the 22yearold had been enjoying a run of games in the team recently after struggling for minutes earlier in the season and showcased his creative influence by setting up two goals in the 50 thrashing of hearts last week in what hamish carton of 67hailhailcom lauded as a coming of age performance

if the scotland leftback doesnt make it for thursday night it would leave lennon deciding between jonny hayes and boli bolingoli to take his place in the team the former came on for taylor against aberdeen but was criticised by many celtic fans afterwards and his performance at pittodrie in which he missed a glorious chance to score was derided as absolutely shambolic by sourav mahanty of thecelticbhoyscom meanwhile bolingoli has been short of match practice playing only the cup win against clyde so far in 2020

while the possible enforced omission of simunovic would be a shame given that he has only just regained a regular starting berth lennon should have enough inform centreback options to overcome the 25yearolds potential absence

however the prospect of taylor missing out is a frightening one given hayes unconvincing form and bolingolis lack of recent action also if the scotland defender has indeed damaged his hamstring after the weekend the chances of him recovering in time for thursday would seem very slim

celtic fans how damaging would the potential absences of simunovic and taylor be for thursday have your say by commenting below

well said anita keep killin it a third user chimed in ; models that use genetic deficiency to infer gene function can be confounded by compensatory actions of coexpressed paralogs for the maxbinding proteins such as myc compensation can occur during embryogenesis and hematopoiesis the present study defines the roles of mycl and mxd1 in batf3dependent dendritic cells our results support the prevailing model of antagonism between myc and mxd family members we show that mycl and mxd1 have reciprocal actions that converge on a shared transcriptional program of biosynthesis during dendritic cell maturation more broadly we identify a physiological setting in which compensation is insufficient to rescue transcriptional deficiencies in mycl and mxd1 mice

we previously found that mycl is required by a batf3dependent classical dendritic cell subset cdc1 for optimal cd8 t cell priming but the underlying mechanism has remained unclear the maxbinding proteins encompass a family of transcription factors with overlapping dnabinding specificities conferred by a cterminal basic helixloophelix domain which mediates heterodimerization thus regulation of transcription by these factors is dependent on divergent nterminal domains the myc family including mycl has actions that are reciprocal to the mxd family which is mediated through the recruitment of higherorder activator and repressor complexes respectively as potent protooncogenes models of myc family function have been largely derived from their activity at supraphysiological levels in tumor cell lines myc and mycn have been studied extensively but empirical analysis of mycl function had been limited due to highly restricted lineagespecific expression in vivo here we observed that mycl is expressed in immature cdc1s but repressed on maturation concomitant with mxd1 induction in mature cdc1s we hypothesized that mycl and mxd1 regulate a shared but reciprocal transcriptional program during cdc1 maturation in agreement immature cdc1s in mycldeficient mice exhibited reduced expression of genes that regulate core biosynthetic processes mature cdc1s from mxd1 mice exhibited impaired ability to inhibit the transcriptional signature otherwise supported by mycl the present study reveals lmyc and mxd1 as regulators of a transcriptional program that is modulated during the maturation of batf3dependent cdc1s ; fairhaven  local soccer star braley freire is bringing her passion for fitness to the local community

in january freire opened bbalanced fitness a fitness studio that focuses on a private approach at 18 center st

the studio offers oneonone personal training small group training four to five people and fitness classes including cardio step kickboxing and yoga

all the offerings purposely allow fewer clients according to freire giving her the ability to offer each client more personalized attention

fitness has always been a part of freires life

the 27yearold grew up in acushnet and was a starter for the new bedford high school girls soccer team all four years she attended and was captain her senior year

she went on to get an athletic scholarship to play soccer at bluefield college in bluefield virginia and later played for the rhode island rogue semiprofessional team

ever since i was young ive always participated in soccer and its just always something that i always did freire said playing for new bedford high that made high school for me

now freire is able to help train a new generation of players at her alma mater

bbalanced fitness also offers team trainings and last year freire started training the girls soccer team even before she opened her studio

its really humbling to go back to your roots and where you grew up freire said of training her high schools soccer team

freire said she decided to open her studio in fairhaven because i love fairhaven its one of my favorite towns and theres nothing like this offered in fairhaven

she said it was important to bring her studio to a town that doesnt have something like it

health is so important in our life and practicing fitness on a daily basis and learning how to eat healthy is so important freire said

bbalanced fitness offers more than just fitness training our main focus is to promote and guide you to live a balanced life through proper health nutrition and fitness

freire has a degree in exercise sports science with a minor in sports management and says learning about the latter really inspired her to open a business

opening my own fitness studio has been my dream freire said its a little piece of me that i can give back to the community

she previously worked at a chiropractic office in fairhaven offering the clients personal training and physiotherapy

freire said many of her clients at the chiropractic office followed her to her studio and shes also had a lot of newcomers who used to keep fit in the past but let it lapse over the years

business so far has been amazing freire said i dont think i couldve had a better first month than i had so far

personal training classes are 175 for 12 30minute sessions or six onehour sessions and the group classes are 10 per class

freire said her clients can expect training with an experienced and educated trainer who at the end of the day is looking out for their best interest and safety and just to help them reach their goals ; the biggest loser is back and well bigger than ever host bob harper dropped by the tv insider offices to chat about the revival now airing on usa

hockey fans in training hockey fit is a threemonth office healthy lifestyle program for men who are overweight or obese and fans of their local hockey team in this case the prince albert raiders

the program was piloted in ontario with the london knights and sarnia sting and has since expanded across canada its free of charge run as a research project by western university and has funding support from the federal government and the movember foundation

its partnered with the raiders and is looking for hockey fans willing to take part

hockey fit is a healthy lifestyle program designed for men who are 35 to 65 and looking to improve their health explained brendan riggin the head coach for the program

as head coach riggin a scientist in the centre for studies in family medicine works with the lifestyle research team and the local hockey fit program to train local staff and implement the program

the program runs once a week for 12 weeks each session lasts for 90 minutes nine of the sessions take place at a fitness facility and three at the host hockey teams facility the fitness facility in prince albert is the cbi health centre

during those sessions we go over some healthy lifestyle tips this is not a diet  its not like we tell them that they cant have certain foods or restrict anything we just try to give them some very management and small changes that they can make to their lifestyle that can have positive improvement son their health

the program also introduces physical activity starting off at a low level to get everyone going

we do accommodate all sorts of backgrounds whether its previous medical conditions or injuries anything like that and we slowly build up their physical activity over the 12 weeks riggin said

outside of the sessions they get participants to take steps and monitor how many theyre taking per day they also build that number up over the 12 weeks to gradually increase it from where the participants begin

holding three of the sessions at the arena is a way to help keep the participants engaged

thats what makes our program a little bit different than some of the more traditional healthy lifestyle programs riggin said

we host some of the sessions at the arena where the guys get a chance to see the dressing room and meet some of the players

they also try to get some coaches and trainers from the majorjunior teams out

thats really the hook to not only get guys to participate in the first place but to get them to continue attending each of the 12 sessions

riggin said the hockey fit teams research has found that its difficult to engage men in healthy lifestyle programs

often they dont go to see their family doctor until its too late or until they know someone else whos had a bit of a health scare he said

unfortunately that costs the canadian health care system quite a bit of money

the estimated cost is bout 37 billion annually the idea is to take a preventative approach to alleviate some of those costs one of the ways theyve been able to do that is to partner with local hockey teams

often these guys are big fans of teams like the raiders they really find that the program is designed for guys just like them

riggin said the program is gender sensitized meaning the content and style of delivery is all tailored for their target market and for fans of the team it allows them to discuss the game and chat with other fans while also getting healthier with small and manageable healthy lifestyle tips riggin says are sustainable for the longterm

so far the program has found success their first goal was to get people to sign up so many signed up during the pilot project that they had to put some on a waitlist

then they wanted to see if the program worked

it had to be simple not too restrictive it cant be too timeintensive either it was successful in helping to improve mens health

riggin said they found that the participants lost about 10 pounds over the 12 weeks when they followed up a year later many were able to maintain that weight loss

we think because we stressed making small and manageable changes to our lifestyle its a much more sustainable approach as opposed to restricting certain foods we all saw positive health outcomes

in addition to the weight loss the pilot participants kept their step count up and lost about 12 mm mercury of their blood pressure which riggin said is equal to about two different medications

from a health research perspective were trying to look at ways of getting guys to be healthy without necessarily relying on those medications because that would be helpful to our health care system riggin said

right now riggin and his team are looking for prince albert men who might be interested in trying the program out its free registration can be found at hockeyfansintrainingorg people can also call riggin at 5196612111 ext 22124

for now the research study and lifestyle program are only open to men but the researchers hope to expand it in the future to create a course for women as well

this pilot study was funded by the movember foundation so this program was focusing on mens health because thats what the priority is of that organization riggin said

we are actively trying to adapt the program to offer a female version and look forward to being able to offer that in the future ; in an instagram post on tuesday the 44yearold actress shared a tribute to marnie alton the fitness trainer who helped get her in shape to play the momturnedzombie on santa clarita diet

happy valentines day to all my loves now where is my chocolate   12 or video honeybirdette lee_lhgfx

a post shared by katelyn runck katelyn_runck on feb 14 2020 at 701am pst

in the video that katelyn included with her post she was shown standing up and staring off into the distance as she played with her hair katelyn was also filmed posing on the bed

the romantic song that can be heard in her video is something just like this by the chainsmokers and coldplay

katelyns post racked up over 28000 likes in the span of a few hours and she also received plenty of love in the comments section one of the models admirers even penned a short poem inspired by her post

happy valentines day yo hips yo thighs you eyes got me hypnotized the fan wrote

i would gladly bring you chocolate or anything else that you would like love photo 2 amazing beauty and muscle tone another admirer remarked

while katelyns fans might think that she looks ravishing in red she also wowed them by rocking white lingerie for another gorgeous photo shoot ; he added when i started playing cricket there was no t20 cricket it was not a physical sport but was a technical one but if now you are not physically fit i do not think you can do well in any format furthermore gambhir also urged girls in the country to take the sport seriously while citing the example of the current womens team who were runnerup in the 2017 50over world cup and semifinalist in the 2018 t20 world cup

moreover he said if girls take up any sport it is a big step towards our vision of making a sporting country i would want girls to take cricket as seriously as men take it if you look at the current womens team they have played world cup semifinals and before that they have been runner up of the world cup it is a very good sign for the country ; bullying is an issue for students it has been an issue for as long as children have been going to school and well before anyone became binary

children are bullied for countless reasons and it is never justifiable to bully anyone how to reduce bullying is a combined effort between parents their children the schools the children attend and the greater society at large

bullying is not confined to the school yard it exists in cyberspace as well as in physical space now please tell me how stopping physical fitness testing for students is going to address the issue

california is experiencing a growth in children with less healthy life habits this is confirmed by increasing levels of obesity which is at least partially due to a more sedentary lifestyle

instead of going outside and playing a physical sport or other physical activity more are sitting with their electronic device and not moving if there is not a successful effort to get more children to be physically active we will see a boom in medical costs in the future when poor habits earlier in life catch up with all of us

it is not a wise decision to stop the physical fitness testing of youth it should and can continue while a study is underway

i agree with letter writer ion puschila that all employees should be treated well however we the taxpayers are funding the treatment of county employees by the taxes we pay

why arent all the county workers paying their fair share of their pensions and benefits why are some groups of employees treated better than others and the taxpayers are left holding the bag to make up the shortfall

i believe that the first financial rule for the county is to fund employee salaries and pensions based on the actual or anticipated income and not on debt financing

how the salaries and pension costs are apportioned should be open to negotiation but no employee should be able to get away without their paying their fair share of pensions and benefits

maybe the supervisors salaries benefits and pensions should be determined after all other employees salaries pensions and benefits have been accounted for within the constraint of the actual county income ; updated new feature comes to the fitbit charge 3 which tracks oxygen in blood while youre sleeping

scott mitchell revealed he has been in discussion with legend phil taylor over ways to improve his fitness

dorset ace mitchell the 2015 bdo world champion is currently taking his first steps towards becoming a player of the rival and more lucrative pdc tour

after failing to secure a tour card in january mitchell won an event on the second tier challenge tour and has subsequently received invites to compete with the main field

he made his pro tour debut last weekend losing 62 to world number one michael van gerwen

mitchell 49 is again set to compete with the sports leading lights this weekend in two players championship events in wigan

and he revealed that a conversation with 16time world champion taylor following his bdo world championship semifinal defeat to wayne warren last month has made him think about how actions away from the oche can help him improve on it

i think i need to do something mitchell told the daily echo

im not saying a fitness regime its no good me going and starting lifting 100 kilo weights above my head 30 times when i play with a 25 gram dart and i wont be able to feel it in my hand

when were talking fitness i think its more cardio more than anything im going to have to look at

but ill do that in different ways with upping the walks with the dogs or whatever and eating a little bit better at better times at night and better things and slowly but surely hopefully that will get me a little bit fitter for these long days

well find out in three months time when i do the next challenge tour and its four events on a weekend

we him and taylor spoke particularly after the world semifinal we didnt speak we just text and he said that what happened being the last quarterfinal at the o2 and then being the first semifinal the next day was a bit unfair with the scheduling

and i said its probably not unfair with the scheduling i said i probably wasnt the right physique for it and he said no youve got to be match fit

that was something phil was very good at not by running and doing anything silly like that its more by diet and a little more exercise and nothing strenuous

thats the way i will look at it and maybe ill get back in touch with him and hell have some ideas for me in the best ways to do it ; when colorado 247 fitness in basalt closed its doors with about 48 hours notice feb 7 more than 400 members were left scrambling to find a new place to get their fitness kicks

fortunately they didnt have to look very far since the midvalley has a plethora of options basalt has another large gym in operation two crossfit centers and numerous boutique workout studios personal trainers and pilates studios

and while one door has closed another is set to open longtime aspen gym owner and operator jeanrobert barbette is preparing to open a 7000squarefoot gym in willits town center in midmay he said he is excited about opening a new gym with new equipment in a new building he had planned the move well before colorado 247s abrupt departure

if we want to grow we have to move downvalley he said he will continue to operate the aspen gym as well but times are changing sixtytwo percent of his clients now live in places downvalley from aspen

the middle class is moving away he said

while he was working toward expansion into the midvalley the closure of colorado 247 worked to his good fortune barbette said he had 12 people reserve space at his new gym online just on the day the other gym closed as of feb 10 he had filled nearly all the 200 spaces being offered at 75 per month for gym access and unlimited classes

barbette bought his space in willits town center so he isnt at the mercy of a landlord and figuring out how to pay escalating rents he intends to limit memberships to between 700 and 800 in basalt

i dont want to pack the place he said

customers also can pay for a package that allows them to work out in basalt and aspen

colorado 247 closed after the heating system broke the landlord said it was the gym owners responsibility to fix it the gym owner said that was financially prohibitive

ryan harrington was among the customers who became a workout refugee due to the closure he had been a member of the gym in that location for 11 years through multiple owners the attraction was an affordable price fun people to work out with in classes and good trainers he said

he also has a punch pass for classes at a competing gym in basalt tac fitness so he had alternatives to pursue harrington said he is examining longterm options  looking at the variety of classes being offered the availability of classes due to crowding and the price he is resigned to paying more than he did at colorado 247 and its predecessors where his rate was 55 per month with unlimited access to classes

i dont think there are enough affordable options harrington said

amanda wagner president and ceo of tac fitness said although there are numerous businesses related to health and fitness in the midvalley there is room for them all

id like to say the market is saturated but theres plenty of room for competition wagner said

tac fitness membership has grown 10 to 20 annually since the gym part of the operation opened in 2013 she said

with swelling populations in carbondale basalt and points in between plus thousands more commuters driving by on weekdays she feels the market is barely tapped the number of members at her gym and other health and fitness businesses is just a fraction of the overall population she noted businesses need to find ways to attract the people who would like to workout but havent pulled the trigger for whatever reason

wagner said there is a growing body of knowledge that exercise helps people live longer at a higher quality of life  and more people are realizing it and acting in addition aging baby boomers realize they cannot just work themselves into shape during ski season anymore they need to keep up their fitness level at an indoor facility

tac fitness has about 1200 members in its 6500squarefoot facility she believes the facility has capacity for as many as 2000 members

one key to staying in business is rolling with the changes as more people have joined wagner has added more equipment capable of a wider variety of functions more classes and more trainers she also added a small group performance center that has been popular

i pay attention to the trends i pay attention to the research i pay attention to our own members she said

she also has secured her business future by purchasing her space

wagner stressed she welcomes competition and believes its healthy for the health and fitness industry to offer so many options in the midvalley her focus she said is to run my business as well as i can

while larger establishments such as tac fitness and jeanroberts gym pull in the biggest crowds multiple niche options exist shawn hunsberger owner of elevation fitness is the model of adaptability he entered the fitness business locally in 2002  first in smallgroup training then as a personal trainer and then as the owner of a fullservice gym that was located where tac fitness now calls home

he paid 7744 per month in rent for the large space and felt like he was always struggling to survive the gym closed in 2013 since then he has rebuilt a smallgroup studio and crafted a strong and stable program that has attracted dedicated customers

he noted that nine fitness businesses pop up in a google search for fitness in basalt there also are multiple pilates and yoga studios

it seems a bit saturated hunsberger said

hes seen a lot of places come and go a lot of times it comes down to a high price per square foot that the businesses are paying it is tough to get enough customers at the price necessary to offset the prohibitive rent

theres just not enough people to sustain that he said

hunsberger said he was fortunate enough to find a 1500squarefoot space on park avenue in the willits design center at a rate that is sustainable he focuses on small groups limiting class sizes to eight people so the trainer can give them attention he remains as passionate as ever i want to help out to keep people healthy he said

margaret hjerleid is another veteran of the local fitness business who used adaptability to her advantage she opened just breathe pilates orthobionomy in october 2018 after working at studio 360 in willits for 11 years she had a great experience there but saw an opportunity for working with her client base she bought a 609squarefoot space in the willits medical center building and has a growing business

for me if you have a special niche you can do very well hjerleid said

she has a different take on saturation of health and fitness businesses in the midvalley pilates is a foundation that focuses on how you organize and move your body

pilates is not meant to be your endall she said

so instead of being possessive of her clients she encourages them to go try other fitness businesses for workouts she refers numerous clients to personal trainer kate lokken at tac fitness for example

hjerleid said she focused for years on honing her pilates service and getting it right to me

do what you love to do and do it really well she said ; its the brilliantly bonkers fitness craze tried by the likes of ozzy osbourne holly willoughby kevin hart and khloe kardashian but you dont need to be a celebrity to have a go in nottinghamshire

goat yoga will be back at white post farm for nine dates between march 1 and july 12 and some sessions have already sold out

a hit stateside with famous faces such as kate beckinsale daughter of nottinghamshireborn actor richard beckinsale and game of thrones sophie turner the fun family classes will be led in farnsfield by instructor polly wiltshire for the third year there will be grownup only sessions available too

tickets for the sessions dubbed yogoat are 15 each or two for 26 from whitepostfarmcouk

deciding to bring together her love of yoga and goats which she has kept for the last 10 years instructor polly approached the farm about the idea of running goat yoga sessions back in 2018

it was playing with my own goats and the joy they found in interacting with me whilst i moved that gave me the idea in the first place polly explains on her website pollyyogacouk

yoga is well know to stretch and strengthen the body and in doing so focus and quiet the mind why adding goats into the equation may appear to separate the activity from a strictly traditional yoga practice it still encourages participants to be mindful you cant be anywhere other than in the moment when you have got new furry friends posing with you or on you she adds

polly of stoke bardolph also provides goat yoga parties if thats your thing which can be booked via her website

the yogoat sessions have proved to be very popular and sold out almost as soon as they were announced in 2018 and 2019

this year they will be taking pace on march 1 8 april 5 may 3 10 june 7 14 july 5 12 ; httpswwwchannelnewsasiacomnewsspog12447252

the idea that chocolate may be healthy is no doubt welcome news for chocoholics but it may leave you wondering if eating chocolate really is healthy the answer depends on what you mean by chocolate and what you mean by healthy

first it is worth understanding what it is about chocolate that may promote health the health benefits of chocolate have to do with the fact that it comes from a plant the cacao tree like many plantbased foods including fruits and vegetables chocolate contains phytochemicals plantderived compounds that have health benefits

indeed chocolate does contain antioxidant flavonoids that have been shown to affect a variety of physiological systems these flavonoids are also found in a wide variety of fruits and vegetables as well as coffee tea and wine the beneficial effects include dilation of blood vessels improved blood clotting and reduced inflammation all of which can reduce the risk of cardiovascular diseases including heart attack and stroke additionally these flavonoids may lower blood pressure regulate insulin levels and reduce stress

the chocolate that we eat contains two main components from the cacao plant cocoa and cocoa butter in addition to added sugar and other ingredients cocoa is the nonfat component of the cocoa bean and cocoa butter is mostly fat the flavonoids are found in the cocoa so chocolate that is richer in cocoa like dark chocolate contains more of these beneficial compounds

for example dark chocolate may contain 70 cocoa compared to 25 cocoa in milk chocolate these flavonoids also give dark sometimes called semisweet chocolate more of a bitter flavor than milk or white chocolate this is also because dark chocolate may contain less sugar than milk chocolate but this isnt always true

milk chocolate contains more of the cacao butter along with other additives usually milk white chocolate is made exclusively from the cocoa butter and contains no cocoa so none of the beneficial phytochemicals even though the fat in cocoa butter is mostly healthier monounsaturated and saturated fats it still contains calories sugar milk and other ingredients also add calories so chocolate is certainly something to enjoy in moderation

one thing to keep in mind is that some of the research into the health benefits of chocolate was conducted in animals not humans and some of the research in humans used isolated extracts from the cacao plant not chocolate and when subjects were given chocolate it was dark chocolate that is high in cacao the point is that the evidence for chocolate being healthy was not based on eating more hersheys bars

but given the potential benefits eating dark chocolate instead of other sweets such as cakes cookies and other candy is probably a good idea simply eating more chocolate in addition to other sweets will not make you any healthier and the extra calories could lead to weight gain look for chocolate that contains at least 70 cocoa sometimes listed on the label as cacao or cocoa solids and remember that a small amount is enough

also keep in mind that many fruits contain the same antioxidants as chocolate so a serving of berries for example is a better choice and finally achieving good health requires more than simply changing one aspect of what you eat so include dark chocolate as a part of a diet that includes real food balanced by daily physical activity ; southern actor sriya reddy is redefining fitness goals with a new gym video of herself sriya who has worked in films like kanchivaram pallikoodam and oraal in tamil took to instagram where she shared a clip of herself doing a intensive workout on the monkey bar

the buccaneers exit from the nedbank cup at the hands of bidvest wits on penalties means they have their winning rhythm disrupted as they sit out the coming weekends last16 clashes of the seasonending cup competition

but their two weeks off also gives bucs a timeout from their charge up the psl log to second place as they aim to bring midfielders ben motshwari and nkanyiso zungu and rightback abel mabaso back to fitness ahead of the saturday february 29 derby against league leaders chiefs

pirates have reported on their official app of the three injuries ben motshwari is recovering from an ankle sprain he suffered at the beginning of the month and is in the final phase of his rehabilitation the 28yearold is expected back in full training soon

nkanyiso zungu has been undergoing rehabilitation on a grade 2 groin strain since signing on the final day of the transfer window from stellenbosch fc and looks set to start cardio work with the strength and conditioning team as they prepare him to start full training

the full extent of abel mabasos injury has been revealed as he was forced off in the nedbank cup clash against bidvest wits mabaso has suffered a grade 2 hamstring strain and is expected to be out for two weeks

pirates have gone 10 league matches unbeaten eight of which have been victories to charge up the log from seventh place to second under new coach josef zinnbauer

a win against chiefs will see bucs reduce the gap on the amakhosi from nine to six points and would see pirates establish genuine title credentials in a season that at one stage saw the team floundering in the bottom half ; bollywood actress and model esha gupta who will open the twoday xyoga dubai festival at kite beach on february 21 with yoga expert jacob manning has been practicing iyengar yoga for the last 10 years for her doing a split  a move that calls for superb flexibility  is her idea of warming up and a comfortable posture to sit

honestly i have been an athlete all my life and yoga has always been a part of my life it has helped me stay active focused and determined  yoga is not just for my body but for my soul said gupta in an exclusive interview with gulf news tabloid ahead of her uae visit

more than 2000 yoga enthusiasts are expected to take part in the event organised by dubai holding at 8am

immediately after her vinyasa free flow yoga session at kite beach gupta  who has acted in films including rustom and baadshaho  will fly to thailand to film her new web series and then shoot for her new movie tipsy in london with director deepak tijori

as she gets ready to take over dubai this weekend heres her take on 

xyoga dubai and her love for it

what excites me is that there will be so many people in one spot doing yoga during early hours of the morning and all you have to do is register online to participate its not some brand promotion but they just want to promote good health  my father is 75 and he still wakes up at 5am to do two hours of yoga every day i started doing yoga while i was in school

honestly i was bored quickly because i had so much energy and i preferred to play active sport but as i grew up i realised the importance of yoga since college i have been practicing yoga out of my own free will i wake up at 6am and i go to bed by 1030pm every day while i am usually hyper as a person yoga grounds me

why she gravitates towards iyengar yoga

i have been practicing iyengar yoga for the last 10 years i want my body to be aligned and this form of traditional yoga helps me achieve that  iyengar yoga is all about breath control and is a combination of postures and pranayama breath control you feel elongated after a session

it also helps me with my strength we use props like ropes and soft bricks but if you are not focused then your breath control isnt right and your asanas poses are not under your control i work out first thing in the morning because you need to concentrate while doing yoga

how yoga helps her deal with public scrutiny and hate

the generation before us was very different there was not so much showing off or so much negativity the maximum you may face is that neighbour auntie who will speak something ill about you but we celebrities get hated a lot  people have become so dependent on social media and its becoming difficult to switch off but that one hour of yoga helps me calm down and relax breathing calms me down and there are times when i end up sleeping towards the end of the session just after five minutes of that you feel so refreshed and invigorated

doing a headstand

i can do it but i dont do it anymore because i got a bad shoulder injury while filming for baadshaho so i dont want to stress my upper body unnecessarily

her goto yoga move

ten surya namaskars sun salutations is my goto routine at times as actors we are shooting at various places or we have to leave home by 6am so all you need is 10 minutes to do those 10 surya namaskars but the trick is to go slow and breathe right in each pose

just hold for five seconds in each pose recently i was in abu dhabi for a holiday and i was doing it every day in my hotel room even today after all these years of doing yoga my legs shake and quiver when holding it but remember go slow to gain strength

her diet

i come from a family of vegetarians we are vegetarians not for religious purposes though although i am a punjabi i have lots of vegetables with collagen in them

i am gluten and dairyintolerant so i avoid it completely when i eat gluten my stomach hurts and i get acidic plus i dont believe in having milk products because i dont think our body needs it i also have carbs until 6pm for dinner i just have dal lentils or soups

gyms being a runway for athleisure and not a temple of fitness these days

i dont understand instagram influencers who put on makeup and head to the gym in my opinion you need to dress up for yourself  whether you are walking on the runway or going out to work when i work out you might often see me without shoes unless i am doing cardio exercises

idea of being fit

it doesnt matter what size you are or what body shape you are the real question is whether you can climb a flight of stairs without any problem  being healthy is not about being thin  i remember seeing my young cousins in dubai and them fretting about being a size four but i told them you can be any size but focus on being healthy and fit i dont want to have a daughter tomorrow whos concerned that she isnt thin

so our focus should be on being healthy and fit lots of designers have banned size zero models and thats wonderful american model ashley graham has such a beautiful face and body you look at her and you know that she works out too and remember just because you are smaller in dress size doesnt mean you are healthier than me

city officials unveiled new outdoor fitness equipment geared toward making exercise easy and more affordable near summerlin and centennial hills

representatives from the national fitness campaign and city of las vegas kicked off exercise at a newly built fitness court during a ribbon cutting jan 28 at bill briare park 650 n tenaya way the blue court has pedestals at various heights pullup bars and metal rings hanging down from poles and the back wall

a workout can be completed in seven minutes with exercises featured on the fitness court app said national fitness campaign founder mitch menaged

theres musical routines for adults of all ages americas best trainers show you how to use the fitness court he said

the project cost about 120000 according to las vegas deputy parks and recreation director maggie plaster who led the project the fitness campaign provided a 30000 grant toward building the court and the parks and recreation department covered 90000 the city ended up covering additional costs not included in that amount such as for pouring concrete and flying out members from the organization to help build the court plaster said

the city was contacted by the national fitness campaign to build a court parks throughout las vegas have similar exercise equipment but they are scattered throughout the parks system and underused plaster said

the fitness court is also durable enough to be outside yearround with minimal maintenance requirements

we found a way to make it happen with our budget plaster said

were building this program all across southern nevada to encourage folks to come outdoors and stay healthy develop a regular practice of fitness and healthy living menaged said adding the organization is in talks to build other courts in henderson and clark county

obesity is an issue all across the country folks are seeing that when they arent active its easy to start picking up a few pounds he said before you know it you start to gain weight and it slows you down

parks and recreation staff members decided where the fitness court would be said city councilman brian knudsen

this is in the heart of the valley in ward 1 in las vegas and we have a great team that can help identify where the most benefit would be this is it knudsen said adding health care was an important issue to him and the court would help people keep healthy

i encourage people all around the valley to come in and try it out because i think as we see some success here this is a model that can be replicated in other parts in the valley he said ; functioning of sports council will be extended to panchayats

sports minister ep jayarajan has announced that nine worldclass fitness centres will be established in the state

one of these centres with modern equipment and competent trainers to enhance the fitness of sportspersons will be established in kannur

he was speaking after inaugurating a threeday international sports expo at mundayad indoor stadium here on tuesday

the minister announced the establishment of a sports school here on the lines of the gv raja sports school in thiruvananthapuram

mr jayarajan acknowledged that there was widespread complaint about the food available at sports hostels

as a solution the amount for food will be sent directly to the childrens account from april he said adding this would allow the children to eat the food of their choice

the sports councils which now functions at the state and district levels would be extended to the panchayat level he said adding competent athletes at the panchayat level would be made officebearers of the council

pointing out that camps are under way to identify footballing talents the minister said such camps would be held in 50 more centres by march

the state government has already given appointments to over 400 athletes who had won medals in the national and international levels he said

the chief minister would issue direct recruitment orders to 195 more persons the minister said

the minister said private entrepreneurs were welcome to invest in the sports sector and the government was encouraging it ; domínguezmuñoz fj villafaina s garcíagordillo ma hernándezmocholi má colladomateo d adsuar jc gusi n effects of 8week wholebody vibration training on the hba1c quality of life physical fitness body composition and foot health status in people with t2dm a doubleblinded randomized controlled trial international journal of environmental research and public health 2020 1741317

sometimes if im fully energized ill do a complete body workout a full two hours i do a full 40 minutes of cardio where im on an elliptical sometimes ill break that down to 30 minutes on an elliptical or 10 on a versaclimber or 15 minutes of sprinting on a versa or climbing 15 seconds of flat out and rest for 45 seconds thats how i start my routine if i want to do a full body workout with every machine it takes close to 90 minutes i do three sets of 12 to 24 depending upon the exercise sometimes ill do really heavy weights where i do three sets of 12 bicep curls of 55 or 60 pounds the next day i might take a 25 pound weight and do a static weight where i do very slow motion half curl up half curl down then half curl then total curl it takes a lot its a different way of burning out your muscle

i have been known to work out seven days a week my average is five days a week sometimes you cant fit everything in all the time but i do it even on saturdays and sundays  i dont miss it when im home when i travel  i just came back from saudi arabia for example  because my schedule is so full i may get two workouts out of four days travel

photo credit michael obryon

at home im lucky to have my own full gym from a cardio room to a full weight room i know my machines i know me when im home i vary my workouts considerably from doing a bosu ball and free weights to doing body weights to doing balance work on balance boards as well as machine weights when im on the road it depends on the gym thats in the hotel nowadays modern hotels have pretty good gyms with very good equipment but when you go to lesser or older hotels the gyms are pretty iffy so you have to improvise that means i can be back in my room with my briefcase weighing 28 or 30 pounds because of all the paperwork that ive got and ill use that as a free weight i improvise the best that i can you can do lunges in your room you can actually do quite a bit if youre willing to figure it out

its different today from what it was when i was playing golf because there are specific golf exercises that you need to do like strength and flexibility i was a very flexible person in my heyday playing golf i could do a full splint against the wall and my back rotation was extremely supple i dont do the stretching as prolifically as i used to do i do some of it on a daily basis because i have a standup desk but today my workout routine today is more of a stress reliever it does me a world of good i work out from 46 pm just about each and every day outside of travel and from a strength perspective i like to keep it that way i dont work out for being ego fit i work out for being life fit

photo credit michael obryon

without a doubt consistency is key for example i do a lot of golf course design work where i walk a lot of virgin sites with sand dunes and mountainous terrain ive found that my stamina is pretty unbeatable to tell you the truth sometimes ill start out on one of these virgin sites and a lot of people will want to follow me and ill look back after a couple of hours and there are maybe two or three people left its a positive sign of course because im trending up still im not flatlining but there have been times in the last 45 days or so where ive felt like going up a plate or up a weight just because i feel like ive plateaued i dont want to get physically bigger i just want to change my program a little bit so my body feels like its not doing the same old routine time and time again as an example i think im going to start kayaking the river i used to do a lot surf skiing growing up in australia and i have two rivers on my property now ive decided that maybe that will be my early morning routine when i go paddle my surf ski for eight miles four there and four back ; manchester city defender aymeric laporte is facing a race to be fit for the return champions league clash with real madrid sources have told espn

strava which tracks the sports activity trends of some 50 million people in almost 200 countries surveyed 25000 runners and found that half of them say they either hate it or barely tolerate it while only 8 love it

but running is often connected with a sense of stability at a deeper level strava said in a report of the surveys findings runners described the need to run to maintain their sense of self and as a way to respond to adversity

theres a great realization that to exercise the body also helps to exercise the mind  which is a muscle that needs just as much looking after as the other muscles said simon klima stravas global marketing director

and love it or hate it the vast majority of runners cited health as a primary motivator for getting out and clocking up the miles more than 80 said they started running to get healthier stronger or have more energy

in brazil 22 of amateur runners said theyd taken up the sport due to a health scare that compares with just 2 in the united states there almost half of respondents said building strength was a core motivator to run  and this was even higher  at 54  among us women german runners were the most likely of the nations surveyed to cite body image as a reason to run  at 47  and in japan 15 say they run to combat feelings of anxiety and depression klima sees this as a sign of the times with social media networks putting pressure on people for how they look its driving up the motivating factor of body image he said the why we run survey  which included respondents from nine countries in north america south america asia and europe  showed how runners worldwide share many common traits

it clustered runners into five key types based on the benefits they value and the extent to which they race or run in social groups

they ranged from passionate runners who run in many social settings and reap the psychosocial benefits like accomplishment and happiness to mindful runners  who tend to run alone  to reluctant runners who rarely compete in races and perceive the fewest social or psychological benefits of all runner types reporting by kate kelland editing by mitch phillips and hugh lawson ; building the basics of fitness tracking into everyday watches has been happening for several years now the withings activite garmin vivomove and several of fossils watches already do it and higherend watches from others are getting into the same game

misfit announced the phase its latest fitness tracker and its going for the same idea a roughly 42mmsize round watch with analog hands has automatic step and sleep tracking no heart rate though the watch is waterresistant to 50 meters and uses a replaceable coin battery to last six months it syncs automatically via bluetooth to your android phone or iphone the watch straps snap out from the back and can be replaced with any natostyle 20mm field band

to check fitness goal status one of the two buttons on the case makes the hands spin around to show your percentage on other competing watches a second smaller dial is often used another button triggers misfits smartbutton controls for connected devices just like its other trackers

the phase vibrates and it also has a notification indicator of sorts a small cutout hole that turns various colors called a color window its not an led light its literally a mechanical part that swaps out color discs odd yes eventually these will be able to be customized in misfits app to correspond to different sources if one of three contacts calls the minute hands will spin to one of three locations and the color eye will turn a certain color its like something out of a weird 60s spy movie

the phase will cost 175 when it debuts in november but the problem is there are already so many watchlike fitness trackers being released lately  including some from fossil which acquired misfit  that unless youre smitten with a particular design youre better off passing the phase has a clean design and a thick but nicely built watch case but its also more expensive than many alternatives like the withings activite steel and garmin vivomove well review one when we get one later this fall ; get healthy and achieve your 2020 goals with best fitness trackers right now assembled in one list

another fan agreed with the caption of her post and said definitely dreamy gorgeous fit queen

one follower called jens instagram update the most stunning thing ive seen today

jen looked stunning in her allpink workout ensemble and it seems that the brunette bombshell has been loving the rosy hue lately just a few days ago as the inquisitr reported jen shared a snap in which she rocked a skimpy pink bikini as she stretched out on the beach ; chris hemsworth of the marvel cinematic universe has expertly taken on the role of thor since 2011 his portrayal of the superhero requires the actor to stay in top physical shape and work hard to preserve his chiseled physique

the avengers star recently launched a fitness app which is designed to benefit users in their daily exercise regimen yet also pays attention to mindset and confidence level inspired by hemsworths own previous challenges with maintaining a strong sense of self

though hemsworth is now one of hollywoods hottest stars the actor once considered getting out of showbiz after a lack of offers following his turn in 2009s star trek i was about to quit he told mens health in january 2019 in that eightmonth period i got more and more anxious to the point where i couldnt harness that energy i was trying to convince myself i wasnt nervous before auditions rather than grabbing hold of it and going use it raise up your awareness here sharpen your focus

the thor actor revealed that changing his mindset was critical in getting career doors to open my mentality changed which came from being at a point where i was like im going to go back to australia he said i had one more audition where i was like think about reasons other than yourself that was for the cabin in the woods and i got that job and from there i got red dawn and then i got thor

hemsworth continued to find greater contentment and confidence by holding on to that outlook someone said to take a batandball approach to auditions so theres your audition then boom on to the next one he shared you cant be thinking about that last one thats where the fear comes when youre like oh god everythings relying on this one single moment which nothing is no single moment ever defines your journey there are so many complicated pieces of the puzzle ive found it comforting letting go a bit

when hemsworth launched his fitness app centr last february he wanted to provide more than just a workout platform for users we all need support to achieve our goals he states on his website centr puts the worlds best in the palm of your hand to help you develop a healthier body stronger mind and a happier life

according to mashable the app offers a workout section for home or the gym with new videos provided each week users can set goals and track progress while choosing their intensity level

the app also places a mindfulness section as a priority with guided meditations exercises to build confidence sleep visualizations coping skills for stress

that was kind of the genesis of this whole centr app  things i learned along the way from meeting people who are leading experts in their fields in mindfulness nutrition and training hemsworth told mens health of creating the app for me to do a great job and not to implode from the anxiety ive got to find that center

with an allencompassing format to cover both the body and the mind hemsworths goal was to present an app that benefitted users both physically and mentally the whole thing was about not becoming stagnant thats when your emotional and physical problems occur i think he said i wanted to create something that embodied the three main elements of healthy living  the movement the nutrition and the mindfulness  and present it in a way thats entertaining functional and also accessible

while the marvel actor is clearly dedicated to physical fitness the demanding regimen can sometimes take its toll on certain days where ive had a few injuries especially during thor im likethis is starting to become a drag hemsworth admitted then really over the last year or so i changed up a lot of my training and nutrition program and its the best ive ever felt

now at 36 years old hemsworth is starting to notice some physical changes from when he was in his 20s i used to be able to get up and sprint and ive found that after lifting weights for such a long time and not getting in touch with your fasttwitch fibers theres such a snappiness that your body had back then he shared the dads race at my kids school last year i hadnt sprinted in about five years and then boom you go and do a hundredmeter sprint at full pelt and my back was cranked for weeks

though the avengers star is getting older he places a priority on mind over matter i dont want to admit that there are things in my 20s that i cant do now hemsworth said im careful not to plant that in my psyche that im getting older and falling apart ; nina serebrova shared a hot new update to her instagram feed and her 27 million fans are going crazy for it

bang never felt so good a third fan chimed in

perfection another one raved also including fire and hearteyes emoji to the message ; homeschooled adolescents may have significantly lower abdominal strength and endurance than public school students who are required to take part in physical education programs according to a new study

this was despite no significant difference between the two groups in measurements of body mass index the researchers found

the study compares specific health metrics between two sets of students age 12 to 17 who have been a focus of the researchers over the past couple of years

while previous work showed homeschoolers should expect no added risk to their general health over time the new study draws a few disparities from a dataset laura kabiri a lecturer at rice university gathered at texas womans university

public school students in the study proved significantly better at performing curlups a metric that measures abdominal strength and endurance

their daily use of backpacks weighing up to 25 of their body weight sufficient to engage corestabilizing muscles could explain that the researchers write

this is actually a hot topic in pediatric health and wellness and i dont want anyone to think we are encouraging students to carry heavy loads in their backpacks kabiri says

we all know that carrying heavy backpacks can lead to musculoskeletal problems in fact the american chiropractic association recommends a backpack weigh no more than 510 of a students body weight

however we are hypothesizing that heavy backpack use among public schoolers could be one explanation for the difference in core strength seen in our study she says

improper instruction and form for abdominal exercises among homeschoolers is another we really dont know the root cause but do see a difference this is why we as health and wellness professionals need to do a better job reaching out to the homeschool community she says

the researchers drew the metrics from 132 participants evenly split between home and public school students the homeschoolers took standardized fitness tests to measure body mass index the ability to run for endurance and the capacity to perform curlups and pushups the researchers matched these results to public school student data collected as required by states

pushup numbers revealed another interesting disparity public school students were on average able to meet requirements but homeschooled students narrowly missed them

there was no significant difference in the mean for the pushup test but it was significant for their health classification says coauthor kendall brice an undergraduate student who will graduate this may

for instance she gave an example in which 17yearold boys in public schools might be required to do 20 pushups and averaged 204 while homeschoolers did only 19 theres no significant difference there but what we see is that more homeschool kids dropped out of the healthy category which mirrors the actual results of the study brice says

how does that happen from my experience our coaches and pe teachers often told us you have to do 20 she recalled or wed ask how many we have to do so the mean is similar but public school kids knew the boundary so they were able to push just past it

kabiri says homeschool adolescents fitness deficits could affect their health in the near term and in the future the solution is to provide better advice for those students and their parents

the main conclusion is that we need to do a better job as health professionals in reaching out to this community kabiri says theyre very well intended and very willing to learn about technique and proper forms for doing these exercises

the new study appears in the american journal of health education the texas physical therapy foundation supported the study ; by katlin younts

tagged with fitness  physical education  ucm graduates

the sports and recreation option for the physical education program was added in fall 2019 and two recent university of central missouri graduates are taking advantage of this opportunity

i think ucm has the best program in the area kailey deatherage said our professors played a huge part because they care about us as individuals instead of just caring about a grade

deatherage is currently a pe teacher in kansas city kan at welborn elementary school teaching kindergarten through fifth grade

i knew i wanted to do something related to fitness and dr kenneth bias introduced me to teaching because he was saying how much of an impact you can create on kids every day deatherage said the kids are only 30 percent of the population now but they are 100 percent part of our future

deatherage said being an elementary pe teacher is definitely a lot of work but she believes this option has prepared her for all the situations shes gone through she believes how shes handled the kids has a lot to do with everything she learned through the sports and recreation option

i am currently working on my masters now but i would like to keep pursuing the physical education career she said my goal is to keep teaching for the next five or six years but eventually i would like to pursue a doctorate in this degree

deatherage said she hopes to eventually end up teaching at a university just like bias has done

like deatherage alex richard is working as an elementary pe teacher he teaches in the park hill school district in kansas city mo

i felt like i was 100 percent prepared to go into my field after the option i chose richard said ucm did a really good job with helping me prepare for life and with my teaching and instructional skills

richard said he always knew he wanted to be a teacher and after talking with professors about decisions on what he could do he knew this was the right path for him

im at a really good school and i love the fact ive helped transition their program into an actual physical education program richard said before it wasnt much of a program the teachers sort of just rolled the ball out and let the kids do whatever

after he completes his masters degree he says he hopes to one day become a principal as well as teach at the collegiate level ; a woman was charged hk938 after downloading what was supposed to be a free fitness app and feeding in personal information

this was one of two complaints received by the consumer council about mobile apps last month there were 20 similar complaints last year up from six cases in 2017 and 2018

in the case of the fitness app the complainant said she had to provide fingerprint verification after downloading the supposedly free app and inputting information such as her fitness target her height and weight and lifestyle habits

but then she received a transaction notification of hk938 via an sms

the mobile sales platform said later the payment was the annual subscription fee of the fitness app

the customer was unhappy at being charged before she had even started a trial use of an app that offered basics such as making a fitness plan a reminder about a need to go walking or running and drinking water

the operator of the platform later agreed to what was described as a onetime special full refund

there was also a reminder for her to cancel the her application to avoid being charged again

in another case a person downloaded a clerical app for a sevenday free trial offer but deleted it before the expiry of the trial period the person later found hk238 had been charged on a phone bill

a staffer at the service provider claimed the company was authorized to charge a mobile app fee according to a purchase record and that any complaint should be directed to the app sales platform or the developer

the person sought assistance from the council after failing to obtain a refund

nora tam fungyee of the consumer councils research and testing committee said people should read details of app services carefully and check information relating to trial periods charging terms automatic subscriptions and cancellations before acting

if an app requires confirmation steps such as face recognition or fingerprints consumers should pay extra attention as it may allow the use of credit card information stored in a mobile phone tam added ; gabby allen posted a new update to her instagram account in which she showed off her incredible flexibility to her 11 million fans

officials with the planet fitness of frederick say  during the holiday season gym usage is fairly low because people are traveling and mostly visiting family

they say when january hits some people usually want to lose that holiday weight and get fit for the summer

the main reason for the increase around this time of year they say is some people want to be fit for the new year

anthony hawkes  general manager planet fitness of frederick everyone wants to hold true to those resolutions that they make in the beginning of the year so numbers definitely go very low in december to incredibly high in january

officials with planet fitness of frederick say those numbers tend to ; while wearable devices like watches have plenty of benefits if you dont want to invest in one just yet your smartphone is an extremely viable and accurate option for holding you accountable to your running and fitness goals

in the age of technology theres a good chance that you  and most people you know  keep track of runs other workouts and daily steps using one device or another but you dont have to buy a highend watch or other wearable to successfully keep an eye on your progress it turns out that the accessory that might keep you the most accountable is the one likely already attached to you 247 your smartphone

new research published in jama network open found that people using their smartphones to track their activity were more likely to continue doing so for a longer period of time than people using wearable devices

the study followed 500 participants  250 tracking their activity using smartphones and 250 using wearable devices  who had been admitted to two different philadelphia hospitals over a period of two years each person was monitored for six months after their initial discharge those who tracked their activity using their smartphones were 32 percent more likely to send in their daily step counts in the six months after being discharged from the hospital than those who used a wearable fitness tracker

we think that most people already carry their smartphones with them and this habit may make it easier to use them to track their activity mitesh s patel md lead study author and director of the penn medicine nudge unit told runners world

if youre unfamiliar with wearable fitness trackers you might not want to go out of your way to research and buy one but nearly 80 percent of adults in the us already own smartphones patel adds so theyre a good tool to track activity levels for extended periods of time and once youve made a smartphone a part of your life chances are youll continue to upgrade it

thats not to say a wearable tracker might not be a good choice sometime down the road but according to patel people could start with using their smartphones and then decide if other information from wearables  such as sleep or heart rate  are needed

a 2015 study in jama found that both types of devices were equally as accurate in counting steps its worth noting though that wearables track metrics such as sleep and heart rate and smartphones typically dont according to patel who was also involved in this research

smash your goals with a runners world training plan designed for any speed and any distance

the bottom line if you dont want to buy a wearable fitness tracker just yet your smartphone is an extremely viable and accurate option for holding you accountable to your running and fitness goals ; kayla itsines most recent social media share is one of her hottest so far as fans of the aussie stunner on instagram know itsines has never been shy when it comes to flaunting her gorgeous figure in a variety of nsfw outfits that includes plenty of workout gear in the latest addition to her colorful feed the smokeshow sizzled in some seriously sexy activewear that left some fans speechless

the actress avoids junk food and makes sure to eat homecooked food for lunch and dinner she has her last meal of the day at around 8pm

when you think of hrithik roshan there are several other aspects which happen to cross your mind a good dancer a fit man a winner an action star and at last but not the least the greek god of india who has the ability to defeat the original greek god in the game of good looks good looks and good looks

man on mission  to live the best life possible come what may thats how hrithik roshan wishes to identify himself in his instagram bio it wouldnt be completely wrong to call hrithik roshan the complete actor and its not just because of his genetic good looks but for his ability to maintain it

age is certainly not a barrier when it comes to hrithik roshan if you are under the impression that remaining fit is no challenge for a man such as hrithik roshan you might be slightly misinformed even when hrithik is not preparing for roles he trains with fitness icon kris genthin it was in 2012 when he was strictly kept on bedrest due to back injuries due to the lack of exercises he was smoking three packs of cigarettes on a daily basis and almost gained a humongous amount of weight after a sufficient amount of rest hrithik had decided to get back to shape since he had slip disc there were restrictions too

to prepare for krissh 3 hrithik roshan used to train for four days a week his focus was on increasing flexibility along with stamina his regular fitness routine included cardio and circuit training hrithik roshan had also consulted a nutritionist maraica johnson to get into a routine with his meals he reduced his oil intakes and consumed eight to ten glasses of water on a daily basis

apart from being an actor hrithik also started his own fitness brand apparel called hrx through which he encourages everyone to stay in shape ; today im releasing my new book fitness for hackers its for men in technology who struggle with their health i wrote it for me

in college i hit a record low err high when i broke 238 pounds as a 5 11 idiot with shaggy hair and no future this was painfully clear when a youtube video i created with my girlfriend went viral for a day

i moved to new york city a year later and told myself ill do better in harlem i joined a gym for 9 month ran central park 23x week and lost 62 pounds in 6 months

i actually lost 55 pounds then had an allergic reaction to a dental cleaning and couldnt chew food for a week which yielded a shortlived 7 pound drop

then what happened i slowly gained it all back

for a long time i made excuses about why i couldnt keep the weight off

then a fit friend of mine scott wanted to hang out he said lets get a protein smoothie i had never been asked to meet for protein only liquor and pizza

this began a sequence of aha moments and experiments the winning end result of those experiments is this book

i know little about omega3 oils lactic acid and all the other stuff your neighborhood personal trainer likes to talk about

instead ive taken an empirical approach does this behavior lead to strength gain or loss does this type of food give me more energy or less

since all my readers have already read 10 fitness books and are still fat i realized something is missing that something is the tiein to what we do every day building products measuring outputs and using our brains

fitness for hackers is a 3 month program you can run on loop just like software iterations and tweaks are expected

first pick a diet the seafood strategy see food and then eat it doesnt work

second learn to spend the minimum viable time in the gym so you dont burn out but lift to failure and track everything i show you how

third measure gains and losses to adjust your regimen as needed from lipid panels to body scans i share my own results

sounds simple right thats the first rule simplicity

most fitness programs dont work because theyre too complicated or they take too much time or they rely on voodoo science like taking cold showers when you wake up fitness for hackers is the antithesis to these advices

this is the first approach to fitness with a hacker mindset

well use kanban mobile apps and spreadsheets to turn our body into a test tube and become our best selves in the process ; for those who continue to procrastinate on their new years resolutions to work out more cornell has another barrier to using its fitness centers price

student wellness comes at a cost at cornell the university charges students an annual fee of 159 or a semester fee of 100 to access the fitness centers such as access to any exercise equipment cardio machines or weights

the membership includes access to all five fitness centers and group fitness classes nonmembers are also provided with some free wellness services such as nutrition or fitness consultations counseling to quit smoking and other programs dedicated to student wellness

there are four gyms spread throughout campus helen newman and appel are located on north campus teagle is on central and noyes sits in west campus

in the ivy league cornell is not unique in charging its students for an annual or semesterbased gym membership columbia university and the university of pennsylvania also charge their undergrads for access columbia prices their membership at 247 for the spring semester pass while penns fee is 334 for the year

however other universities like harvard yale princeton brown dartmouth and mit offer undergraduates free access to their fitness centers

for many students cornells gym fee deters them from utilizing any of the universitys facilities craig schulman 22 said he neglects going to the gym because of the hefty fee

its why i dont have a membership a lot of my friends at other schools arent charged for the gym and 159 is a lot of money

lance rombro 23 also voiced his annoyance

it seems unreasonable that we attend such a prestigious and wellendowed institution yet the university makes workingout and student wellness a luxury rombro said

however cornell does offer some costless options through its fitness for free programs programs one of these options is that students can access appel helen newman or noyes without charge on friday and saturday evenings but a swipein is required at any other time during the week

swimming pools are also accessible for free at teagle and helen newman during open swim hours and students can play basketball tabletennis and badminton at noyes and helen newman or take a free pe class ; with over 101k followers on instagram actormodel mugdha godse is a fitness inspiration for many so naturally a query that comes her way often is whats your diet plan or whats your fitness mantra heres the answer

with over 101k followers on instagram actormodel mugdha godse is a fitness inspiration for many so naturally a query that comes her way often is whats your diet plan or whats your fitness mantra and the answer is simple i eat right and do yoga says godse as she lists her daily regime to us the 33yearold starts her day with ashtanga yoga followed by cardio exercises such as walking and running or swimming in the evening godse also has a fixed morning ritual that she swears by i start my mornings with a shot of turmeric water which is brewed with ginger garlic apple cider vinegar honey and lemon it is an immunity booster after that i have three glasses of warm water she says

for breakfast the fashion 2008 actor usually opts for eggs or any maharashtrian dish for lunch she prefers salads my meal timings arent fixed it depends on when im feeling hungry for dinner i can have any dal with rice and multigrain roti if im going out i prefer soups or salads she says

being an eggetarian she prefers to stick with homemade food and follows a detox regimen including salads and juices thrice a month

the actor however says she doesnt believe in intermittent fasting and the fad diets that flood the internet every now and then even though these diets are good to reach a certain target godse feels they arent very healthy and sustainable there is a myth that vegetarians dont have enough nutritional food options one can have a green smoothie with kale and spinach flax seeds for omega 3 and lentils for protein you dont need meat one should also not completely leave dairy products according to me certain quantity of dairy is important suggests godse ; even before the outbreak of the coronavirus 2019 covid2019 at the start of the year gyms and fitness centers have been the perfect breeding ground for contracting a viral bacterial or fungal infection if one is not careful after all it is a place where exercise equipment and bathroom facilities are shared by strangers saliva droplets moist bathroom surfaces moldy mats and benches pose the risk of infection for a plethora of diseases

in the time of covid19 fitness clubs should take on the responsibility of seeing to it that their facilities set up the best possible measures to prevent the spread and transmission of this global scourge here are some steps that responsible establishments can take

time and again the world health organization who and the philippine department of health doh have reminded us that frequent handwashing and disinfecting our hands is an effective means to prevent the spread of disease by providing additional hand sanitizers in strategic areas around the gym people are encouraged to disinfect their hands often preferably before and after handling gym equipment

some offices and commercial establishments already use noncontact thermometers at all entry points and refuse entry to individuals whose body temperature would indicate a fever the same should go for gyms also individuals with colds runny nose coughs and other ailments should be encouraged to go home and rest until they are feeling better

by now most of us know that the virus can survive on solid surfaces for hours by providing sprayon disinfectants and paper towels in strategic areas fitness centers provide the means to wipe away the virus and stave off infection needless to say gym equipment must be wiped down before and after use

again this practice which is currently widespread in many companies in the philippines must be used by fitness centers take note that some of their employees particularly fitness instructors come in close contact with clients employees who traveled to china or any of its regions should be quarantined for 14 days whether or not they exhibit flulike symptoms taking it a step further they can extend this quarantine to employees who have had a member of his or her household travel to china

surely the more reputable establishments are already practicing the abovementioned steps well and good after all we go to the gym to be in the best of health to presumably live longer more productive lives let us all take the necessary precautions to ensure that we emerge from our workouts stronger and healthier individuals ; kayla itsines a personal trainer who has 122 million followers on social media platform instagram took to the site on thursday february 27 to demonstrate yet another circuit of simple exercises  this time targeting posture

 buy the new timex ironman r300 gps at timex for 120

and if the timex ironman name rings a bell you are right the nonsmart variety of this range has long been a diehard triathlete favourite so much so that we included it on our best triathlon watch guide as a bonus entry at the end granted the timex ironman classic 30 doesnt do much apart from telling the time and lap times but thanks to its retro looks it still has a cult following

now the new timex ironman r300 is much smarter than its predecessor it comes with a touchscreen display builtin gps speed and distance tracking features and if all is true the timex ironman r300 will also support some level of smart notifications as well

the 120 price tags sounds very reasonable quite cheap in fact and we dont know much about the precision or even the features of the fitness smartwatch on timexs website the description has the following to say

and apart from the fact that the above features could be classified as grammatically incorrect they also dont shed much light on what technology has actually been included in the timex ironman r300 gps

what we do know is that the battery life will be an excellent up to 25 days in smartwatch mode and up to 20 hours in gps tracking mode which is not too shabby timex is also very keen to advertise the guided coaching feature send workouts directly to your watch including jared wards 12week running program get ready to train for your next big race  from 5ks to half or fullmarathons not sure if it is a match to the garmin coach but for this money the timex coach is definitely admirable

 buy the new timex ironman r300 gps at timex for 120

there is quite literally no information about what the type of position tracking and heart rate sensor has been included in the timex ironman r300 gps we do know that it is water rated to 30 metres which was kind of expected especially since it has the word ironman included in the watchs name

we are keen to learn more about this fitness smartwatch in the near future ; fitness model katelyn runck has a sharp sense of style and an incredible body on wednesday she put both on display in her recent instagram update the post saw her rocking a skintight dress that fit her like a glove

many of her admirers gushed over how pretty she looked

stunningly beautiful awesome body one fan wrote

earlier this month katelyn showcased her figure  and a lot more skin  when she shared a snap that caught her wearing a skimpy bikini ; peloton and a group of music publishers have settled a series of lawsuits that alleged the fitness company used thousands of songs without permission peloton also reached an agreement with the trade group that represents those publishers the national music publishers association nmpa to optimize its music licensing process theoretically meaning it will end up properly paying for music rights going forward

in total 14 members of the nmpa ended up suing peloton last year over claims that it used more than 2000 songs without a license those songs allegedly included tracks from lady gaga ed sheeran justin timberlake st vincent and many more and were said to be used in one or more fitness videos over the preceding three  ; its been a mediocre week for planet fitness inc nyseplnt shareholders with the stock dropping 14 to us7577 in the week since its latest fullyear results planet fitness reported in line with analyst predictions delivering revenues of us689m and statutory earnings per share of us141 suggesting the business is executing well and in line with its plan earnings are an important time for investors as they can track a companys performance look at what top analysts are forecasting for next year and see if theres been a change in sentiment towards the company we thought readers would find it interesting to see analysts latest statutory postearnings forecasts for next year

see our latest analysis for planet fitness

taking into account the latest results the current consensus from planet fitnesss 14 analysts is for revenues of us7759m in 2020 which would reflect a decent 13 increase on its sales over the past 12 months statutory earnings per share are expected to shoot up 26 to us178 before this earnings report analysts had been forecasting revenues of us7828m and earnings per share eps of us176 in 2020 so its pretty clear that although analysts have updated their estimates theres been no major change in expectations for the business following the latest results

it will come as no surprise then to learn that the consensus price target is largely unchanged at us8614 it could also be instructive to look at the range of analyst estimates to evaluate how different the outlier opinions are from the mean there are some variant perceptions on planet fitness with the most bullish analyst valuing it at us10000 and the most bearish at us6900 per share there are definitely some different views on the stock but the range of estimates is not wide enough as to imply that the situation is unforecastable in our view

another way to assess these estimates is by comparing them to past performance and seeing whether analysts are more or less bullish relative to other companies in the market its pretty clear that analysts expect planet fitnesss revenue growth will slow down substantially with revenues next year expected to grow 13 compared to a historical growth rate of 17 over the past five years by way of comparison other companies in this market with analyst coverage are forecast to grow their revenue at 84 next year even after the forecast slowdown in growth it seems obvious that analysts still thinkplanet fitness will grow faster than the wider market

the most obvious conclusion from these results is that theres been no major change in the business prospects in recent times with analysts holding earnings per share steady in line with previous estimates happily there were no major changes to revenue forecasts with analysts still expecting the business to grow faster than the wider market there was no real change to the consensus price target suggesting that the intrinsic value of the business has not undergone any major changes with the latest estimates

with that said the longterm trajectory of the companys earnings is a lot more important than next year we have forecasts for planet fitness going out to 2024 and you can see them free on our platform here

it might also be worth considering whether planet fitnesss debt load is appropriate using our debt analysis tools on the simply wall st platform here ; theres no confirmation from google on whether these features will make its way to wear os but this survey is certainly a step in the right direction

the survey talks about a wide range of features including the ability to monitortrack sleep apnea sp02 or the potential to pair medical equipment more easily with smartwatches including automatic detection the survey asks participants how they would feel about the presence of a feature and the absence of it thus helping gauge the participants accurate reaction to some of the new features proposed

jamaican gymnast danusia francis says that she is closer to a return to full training as she nurses injuries which have limited her preparations for the olympic games in tokyo this summer

the 25yearold francis who will be jamaicas second athlete to compete in the sport at the olympics after toniann williams appearance at the rio 2016 games said that the problems started in november when she suffered a thumb injury

her bid to make a quick return led to more complications which set her back further in her preparations ahead of the july 24  august 9 olympic games

unfortunately i hurt my thumb in november and then it wasnt fully recovered and i trained on it so this led to a back injury so now im trying to be patient and not make the same mistake twice in rushing back into full training francis told the gleaner

she says however that she is improving and although frustrated that it has hampered her preparations for this summers games she is grateful that the timing has not robbed her of the opportunity entirely

i am now at about 75 per cent and i am able to do more each day it is frustrating but i am glad it happened now and not closer to tokyo she added

in the buildup towards tokyo francis is currently participating in league competitions in spain and italy and is expected to compete this weekend in the serie a league in ancona italy even though she will not be attempting her full set of routines

despite the setback francis who hopes to be back to full fitness by late april believes that the timing has been a blessing in disguise as the setback has also forced her not to push herself too much in training

it is easy to burn out in this sport so in some ways it has prevented me from overtraining too early in the year i have been able to work on other weaknesses with the extra time during training i am also experienced and i know my body well francis said the pain i am in right now i could push through but since we have enough time i am able to take a more cautious approach and recover in a timely manner

francis is hoping to continue the momentum she gained last year when in addition her olympic qualification last october she became the first jamaican gymnast to compete in a gymnastics final at the pan american games a feat she achived last summer in lima peru

with the olympics now just a few months away francis feels that keeping the same routine and mindset will serve her well rather than making any changes at this stage

it is good to always be adaptable and open to learning about different areas that might help you but i think i have got this far so i wouldnt make significant changes this close to the finish line francis said ; knoxville tenn wate  a local scientist claims to have faced racial discrimination at a knoxville gym

in the two photos ainsley sizzled while taking the pictures selfiestyle in a full length mirror the outfit consisted of a sleeveless jumpsuit that featured a bold plunging neckline that was so deep that it nearly hit her belly button the daring top was cinched in at the waist with a ribbon belt accentuating her trim torso honed from hours at the gym

the sleeveless cut of the top meant that ainsley could show off her toned arms and the loose back yet added another sultry aspect to the outfit the lower part of the jumpsuit featured a trendy wide leg that was the perfect chic accent to the look

ainsley opted for a sleek bun hairstyle to complement the outfit and favored a freshfaced makeup look to keep focus on the jumpsuit she similarly had few accessories with just a pair of stud earrings and silver cuff bracelet

ainsley completed the ensemble with a pair of gold highheeled sandals and a fashionable black valentino rockstud clutch

in the first of the two pictures ainsley angled slightly sideways to highlight her curves in a classic mirror selfie pose the second appeared to be almost exactly the same only with a much larger smile than the first shot

in her caption ainsley confessed that the upload was a throwback as she was currently wearing comfier attire after having surgery earlier this week

the chic ensemble is a far cry from ainsleys attire last weekend when she opted for a more casual look while at the beach in search of some vitamin sea as covered by the inquisitr the social media star wowed her fans while modeling a green and purple floral bikini along with a trendy panama hat ; the desire to protect children is understandable but what some are doing takes that instinct to an unhealthy extreme

the a to f grading system is a childhood staple it clearly tells teachers and parents how well a student is doing in different subjects yes it can be uncomfortable for a child to tell his parents that he got a d in english his parents might even take away some of his privileges in favor of increased study time having to do extra schoolwork can be a chore whats worse is graduating from high school without knowing how to read grades provide regular feedback that is essential to helping children obtain the skills they need to do more than work a cash register at mcdonalds

but thats not how some people view it writing in the college fix last week christian schneider described his shock when he opened his daughters second grade report card her madison wisconsin school district uses the grades ex m dv and e he didnt know what those terms meant either the school had to provide a key to help parents decipher a second grade report card

those letters stand for exceeding meeting developing and emerging to make it more confusing the school district defined each of those grades in the rosiest possible terms

student begins to show initial understanding of gradelevel expectations for the end of the year the definition of emerging reads thats a rosy way to describe a failing student

its not just grades where some adults want to shield students from reality earlier this month california gov gavin newsom proposed suspending the physical fitness test given to state fifth seventh and ninth graders hes concerned the test which measures students aerobic ability strength and flexibility leads to body shaming and bullying results show that students have room to improve around 20 percent of students are in the needs improvement  health risk category for body composition

schools shouldnt  and dont  broadcast individual student results the data is part of a students confidential file which is protected by state and federal law but letting kids know that their inactivity is putting their health at risk isnt bullying its alerting them to reality which gives them time to improve their health

what produces lasting confidence  and selfesteem  isnt shielding children from every difficulty its setting a consistent ageappropriate standard and helping them achieve it no matter how many times it takes you cant do this when bureaucrats and politicians send the message that everyone is a winner no matter someones effort level or results ; wiseguyrerportscom presents global gymclub fitness trackers market insights forecast to 2025 new document to its studies database the report contain 110 pages with detailed analysis

in general the term transmitted founder tf virus refers to a single or very few viral variants that establish productive infection within a host this definition is based on certain unique genetic and phenotypic properties such as the presence of fewer pngs and shorter variable loops v1v2 studies have shown that shorter v1v2 loops and fewer pngs are associated with enhanced sensitivity to neutralizing antibodies in addition a consistent pattern of ccr5 coreceptor usage greater resistance to fusion inhibitors increased infectivity andor faster replication rate and resistance to ifnα have also been reported as unique features of tf variants

on the other hand nontransmitted nt variants constitute a genetically diverse population of hiv1 isolates that are sensitive to maternal antibodies studies have shown that the viral variants in the transmitting partner were different from the transmitted founder virus in the newly infected partner in this study we identified tf and nt variants by comparing the genetic identity between the different infectious clones generated from the same individual as well as the hiv1 env dna isolated from peripheral blood mononuclear cells pbmc of the infant tf viruses and the provirus in the pbmcs are reported to have a very close genetic signature shorter variable regions and fewer pngs nontf viruses have longer variable regions greater number of pngs and show increased sensitivity to neutralizing antibodies the phenotypic differences between the two virus types described in this article have been reported earlier by our group

all phenotypic assays were performed using 293 t cellderived viral stocks from patientderived gp120 cloned into pmnk7luciressnefδgp120 based on genotypic and phenotypic assays the chimeric viruses were identified as either tf or nt viruses the tf and nt chimeric viruses were independent viruses obtained from the same individual infected recently through mtct all the chimeric viruses were phenotyped as subtype c and were found to be ccr5 tropic but few of the tf viruses used the cxcr6 coreceptor in addition to ccr5 for infection majority of the tf and nt viruses that were reported previously by others were derived from chronically infected individuals rather than from recently infected individuals however in this study we derived all the chimeric viruses from recently infected individuals

the chimeric viruses were normalized to 50 tissue culture infective dose tcid by measuring luciferase expression in terms of relative light units rlu in tzmbl cells we used tcid for normalization of viral stocks because this value directly correlates with the absolute number of infectious viral particles whereas quantification of p24 antigen or rt activity gives the total absolute number of viral particles that would include both infectious and noninfectious particles hence normalization using p24 antigen or rt activity for the determination of moi would not be accurate

we determined the saturation point of maraviroc mvc on the recombinant viruses by treating them with varying concentrations of 10fold serial dilutions starting from 1  10 nm and going down to 1  10 nm in a singleround infection assay in tzmbl and ghost 3 ccr5 hi5 cells the ec values were found to be higher for tf viruses than for nt viruses when tested in tzmbl cells however there was not a much difference seen in the ghost 3 ccr5 cells to derive the saturation point the percentage inhibition was calculated for each mvc concentration as the rlu measured 48 hours postinfection in both tzmbl and ccr5 cells and the percentage inhibition in the absence of mvc set to 100

it was observed that there was no increase in inhibition of viruses between 01 and 1 µm mvc concentration indicating that mvc at or above 01 µm concentration did not inhibit the virus further we defined the point at which there was no further inhibition of viral growth as the saturation point and determined percentage residual infection between the two concentrations the average percentage residual infection by tf and nt viruses was found to be 388 and 157 respectively in tzmbl cells fig 1a demonstrating greater than onefold change 13 difference in percentage residual infection between the tf and nt viruses at 001 µm concentration however at 01 µm concentration the difference was insignificant also we did not observe a significant difference in the percentage of residual infection between tf and nt viruses tested in ghost 3 ccr5 cells 166 and 114 respectively fig 1b percentage inhibition of individual viruses is provided in supplementary fig 1

to determine the interferon set point to carry out the experiments in cd4 primary t cells we tested three different concentrations 250 500 and 750 iuml in tzmbl cells with chimeric viruses virus expression was measured by the intensity of rlu for each ifnα concentration after 48 hours of infection and plotted as the percentage of viral infection in the absence of ifnα which was set to 100 the expression of each chimeric virus isolate was calculated based on rlu levels in normal condition for few chimeric viruses which resulted in higher levels of viral expression in the presence of 250 iuml of ifnα than in the absence of ifnα the percentage of expression was normalized to 100 the average percentage of infection against different concentrations 250 500 and 750 iuml of ifnα tested was found to be 49 446 and 413 respectively fig 2a

the average percentage infection of chimeric viruses in the presence of 750 and 500 iuml of ifnα was found to be nearly similar however the infection rate varied significantly between tf and nt viruses identified from the same individual fig 2b the infection rate at 750 iuml of ifnα was found to be 671 for tf virus whereas the infection rate for the corresponding nt virus was 342 with nearly onefold 097 difference however the fold change was almost equal 085 and 087 at concentrations between 250 and 500 iuml with infection rates of 756 and 693 for tf and 418 and 378 for nt viruses respectively the infection rate differed significantly at all the three concentrations of ifnα between tf and nt viruses

recent studies in subtype c hiv1 infection showed that there was no significant difference in ifnα activity on tf and nt viruses derived from the same individual on the other hand in individuals infected with subtype b virus the tf viruses were found to be relatively more resistant to ifnα than nt viruses to substantiate the antiviral effect of ifnα on subtype c chimeric viruses derived from recent vertical infection we infected phytohemagglutinin pha stimulated primary cd4 tcells with an equal amount of tf and nt viruses from the same individual by treating one half with ifnα and the other half without ifnα p24 antigen release in cultures treated with and without ifnα was quantified as an indirect measure of resistance to ifnα for the tf and nt viruses the percentage resistance at each time point for tf and nt viruses is presented in fig 3a we noticed only a small difference in resistance between tf and nt viruses at the earliest time point postinfection 3 day however ifnα resistance of tf viruses increased to nearly twofold change than that of nt viruses at two consecutive time points 6 and 9 day the percentage resistance of tf viruses declined significantly to 67 and 637 on the 6 and 9 day respectively from 84 on the 3 day subsequently on day 12 it was observed that the nt viruses became resistant to ifnα and that the tf viruses lost their resistance to ifnα the difference in resistance between the two groups of viruses was statistically significant at all time points except on day 3 at the same time the percentage of resistance for pnl43 and jrfl viruses in culture supernatants at the earliest time point was around 80 fig 3b however in the next consecutive time points the percentage resistance of pnl43 virus increased significantly and then started decreasing at the latest time point 12 day in contrast the jrfl virus responded slightly to ifnα on the 6 day and after that started gaining resistance to ifnα

in addition to the quantification of p24 we sorted the gag tagged cd4 t cells 12 days postinfection with tf and nt viruses for the determination of ifnα resistance the presence of gagpositive cells by flow cytometry was used as an indirect measure of infection of cd4 t cells the mockinfected cd4 t cell culture was considered as cell control and was used to set the manual gate to calculate the percentage of virusinfected cells data obtained from facs analysis are presented in fig 4 nonviable cells were removed by manual gating based on livedead cell staining figure 4a shows the expression of gagpositive cd4 t cells in cultures treated with and without ifnα the preparation of cd4 t cells for facs analysis is summarized in fig 4b taken together the ratio of virus produced by the chimeric viruses in the presence and absence of ifnα correlated significantly with the percentage of gagpositive cells p  0048 fig 4c gagpositive cd4 t cells were found to be higher in the tf virus group than in nt viruses though the difference was not statistically significant fig 4d notably a few tf viruses replicated to significantly high titers in the absence of ifnα than in the presence of ifnα these seemingly disparate findings in contrast to the previous findings could be either because the virus produced from the cd4 t cells infected by tf virus became sensitive to ifnα or because cd4 t cells infected by nt virus produce ifnα resistant particles during the course of infection

we next sought to investigate the replication kinetics of tf and nt viruses in primary cd4 t cells cd4 t cells in the mucosaassociated lymphatic tissue are the predominant targets of hiv and are infected productively soon after the moment of transmission phastimulated cd4 t cells derived from healthy individuals were infected with an equal number of virus particles based on the tcid value and the replication kinetics of a subset of chimeric viral isolates n  16 along with tropism dependent and independent viral controls jrfl and pnl43 were determined the experiments were carried out in the presence and absence of ifnα for 12 days and p24 antigen was measured in culture supernatants collected every 72 hours we then compared the p24 antigen released by tf and nt virusinfected cd4 t cells cultured in two different conditions with and without ifnα between single and multiple time points and the results are presented in fig 5a

in the absence of ifnα the average total p24 released by tf viruses was comparatively lesser than that of nt viruses 1229 pgml for tf viruses interquartile range iqr 767 to 1848 pgml and 1785 pgml for nt viruses iqr 856 to 3159 pgml p24 levels measured at the earliest time point in tf viruses 3 day postinfection was not significantly different from that of nt viruses the p24 level at this time point was 356 pgml iqr 219 to 575 pgml for tf viruses and 202 pgml iqr 1614 to 286 pgml for nt viruses with a 082fold change however between days 6 to 12 the p24 level decreased for tf viruses as was reported previously when compared to nt viruses

in contrast the sum of the mean p24 levels of tf viruses was found to be 790 pgml iqr 510 to 1318 pgml which was higher than that of nt viruses which was estimated as 614 pgml iqr 444 to 796 pgml in cultures treated with ifnα the average p24 level at three different time points day 3 6 and 9 for tf viruses 251 206 and 198 pgml was significantly higher than for the nt viruses 146 119 and 149 pgml respectively however the amount of p24 determined on day 12 was found to be halffold lower for tf viruses when compared to nt viruses 135 vs 200 pgml the p24 level at different time points and different culture conditions for all the viral isolates tested are provided in supplementary fig 2

when compared to jrfl and pnl43 which served as controls fig 5b the tf viruses showed similar or about onefold lower p24 levels in supernatants collected at different time points from cultures with and without ifnα in contrast the nt viruses showed increased levels of p24 in all supernatants harvested at different time points except on day 3 in cultures without ifnα than jrfl but it was reversed in cultures with ifnα in both the conditions the p24 level in tf and nt viruses was approximately onefold lower than that of the pnl43 virus when the virus controls were compared with each other the p24 level of pnl43 was found to be onefold higher than that of jrfl in supernatants harvested from both culture conditions and at all time points

encouraged by the previous findings we went one step further to quantify the production of viral particles from cd4 t cells infected with tf and nt viruses in cultures treated separately with ifnα and mvc before infection newer studies have provided evidence that cd4 t cells infected with tf viruses release comparatively vast numbers of cellfree viruses than nt virusinfected cells we measured the amounts of cellassociated and cellfree p24 antigen nine days postinfection and used these values to determine the productivity of tf and nt viruses as expected total both cellfree and cellassociated amount of p24 was found to be significantly higher with 13 and 09 fold increase for tf viruses than for nt viruses in cultures treated with ifnα and mvc respectively also there was no significant difference between cultures infected with tf viruses as compared to jrfl virus in both the conditions but the fold change was 12 and 14 lower when compared to the pnl43 virus in respective conditions the amount of p24 antigen produced and fold change values are presented in fig 6ac for ifnα and 6eg for mvc

however it was surprising to note that the ability to produce viral particles in ifnα and mvc selected cultures infected with tf viruses was lower than for cultures infected with nt viruses fig 6dh this difference though was not statistically significant the productivity of p24 in cultures infected with the chimeric viruses and control viruses jrfl and pnl43 were comparable with no statistical significance the average productivity of tf and nt viruses was around 62 and 67 respectively in both ifnα and mvctreated cultures whereas the productivity with jrfl and pnl43 was 77 and 62 respectively in ifnαselected and 71 and 60 in mvcselected cultures respectively ; study objectives microsleep episodes mses are short fragments of sleep 115 s that can cause dangerous situations with potentially fatal outcomes in the diagnostic sleepwake and fitnesstodrive assessment accurate and early identification of sleepiness is essential however in the absence of a standardised definition and a timeefficient scoring method of mses these short fragments are not assessed in clinical routine based on data of moderately sleepy patients we recently developed the bern continuous and highresolution wakesleep bern criteria for visual scoring of mses and corresponding machine learning algorithms for automatic mse detection both mainly based on the electroencephalogram eeg the present study aimed to investigate the relationship between automatically detected mses and driving performance in a driving simulator recorded in parallel with eeg and to assess algorithm performance for mse detection in severely sleepy participants methods maintenance of wakefulness test mwt and driving simulator recordings of 18 healthy participants before and after a full night of sleep deprivation were retrospectively analysed performance of automatic detection was compared with visual mse scoring following the bern criteria in mwt recordings of 10 participants driving performance was measured by the standard deviation of lateral position and the occurrence of offroad events results in comparison to visual scoring automatic detection of mses in participants with severe sleepiness showed good performance cohens kappa  066 the mse rate in the mwt correlated with the latency to the first mse in the driving simulator rs  054 p  005 and with the cumulative mse duration in the driving simulator rs  062 p  001 no correlations between mse measures in the mwt and driving performance measures were found in the driving simulator multiple correlations between mses and driving performance variables were observed conclusion automatic mse detection worked well independent of the degree of sleepiness the rate and the cumulative duration of mses could be promising sleepiness measures in both the mwt and the driving simulator the correlations between mses in the driving simulator and driving performance might reflect a close and timecritical relationship between sleepiness and performance potentially valuable for the fitnesstodrive assessment show more ; day of reckoning michelle bridges 49 was today forced to accept she wasnt special in the eyes of the law  but just another drink driver

it was the day michelle bridges celebrity fitness guru and tv star was forced to accept that she wasnt special in the eyes of the law  but just another drink driver

bridges 49 brought celebrity glamour a supportive entourage and legal firepower to a drab courtroom in sydneys east on tuesday

it was judgment day for the former biggest loser trainer and she was hoping to escape a conviction for midrange drink driving

but even wheeling out a heavyweight defence barrister  who insisted she was a special case quoted shakespeare and regaled the court of her achievements  couldnt win her leniency

bridges predicament began with a glass of wine with dinner about 8pm on january 25 the court has heard

she drank quite a bit afterwards  four vodka sodas all apparently at home  before finishing up at 1am the next day australia day she rose that morning and took her son five to nielsen park beach not far from her potts point home

the incident came while the former biggest loser star was reckoning with the collapse her relationship with steve commando willis

bridges second from right rose to fame with the biggest loser costars shannan ponton tiffiny hall and the commando  her former lover

bridges was driving home at 1125am when officers at a roadside breath stop noticed her range rover broke suddenly and veered into the second lane of new south head road

police decided to pull bridges over when she wound the window down police noticed the fitness star appeared nervous her hands were shaking voice was trembling and face was flushed court documents said

the glamorous fitness trainer never suggested she was anything but guilty to the offence  proof her lawyer claimed that she was a straight shooter

the 12 week body transformation founder claimed she had a swirl of mouth wash about five minutes before she was pulled over

but officers observed she seemed mildly affected by alcohol she admitted drinking last night and she failed the test

back at the police station the wiry fitness queen admitted she had actually drank quite a lot a statement of facts said

it wasnt long after a criminal charge was laid that the incident hit the headlines

bridges to her credit never suggested that she was anything but guilty

she revealed she had been going through a difficult time having just split with her high profile boyfriend steve the commando willis who she met on the biggest loser that had apparently played a part in her heavy drinking

she admitted her shame and embarrassment and suffered a terrible blow to her wholesome public image

it was shame she relived again on tuesday as she walked the media gauntlet at waverley court

the stress was written all over bridges face as she leaped out of a car about 915am

she powered past at least a dozen media  cameras in her face clicking and flashing

time to face the music a magistrate told celebrity fitness trainer michelle bridges what she didnt want to hear on tuesday  she wasnt getting leniency and would be convicted

once inside she her lawyers and three supporters huddled in a conference room all morning even through the courts lunchbreak

this is a special case

michelle bridges lawyer queens counsel tony bellanto

her lawyers were trying to secure her time a magistrate who would knock the case over in an afternoon and bring her monthlong nightmare to an end

about 2pm it was bridges turn to face the music

she strode into the main court of the small complex and sat in the front row in a black suit next to her lawyer metres away sat other people accused of similarly serious but lowlevel crimes none appeared to have lawyers with them  let alone a qc

from the beginning it was clear bridges had an uphill battle asking the court for leniency

tony bellanto qc told magistrate allison hawkins  newly minted fresh from the bar  that bridges crime which she was pleading guilty to had cut to her core he pleaded with the magistrate for leniency saying a conviction for bridges would be a scar on the record for the rest of her life

the drink driving charge is a rare moment of humiliation for bridges who has gained national fame as a celebrity fitness guru

shes a good mother shes hardworking he said she had contributed so much to the community he said

he cited an extraordinary statistic in his submissions over 10 years she is responsible for the australian public losing two million kilograms in weight he said now that is powerful 

meanwhile he argued bridges had written a letter of apology to the court and was remorseful she had learned so much from completing a program for traffic offenders

she could be an advocate for change thanks to her new understanding of drink driving mr bellanto said she was entitled to leniency from the court given her capacity to make a difference he argued

but magistrate hawkins said the absolute majority of cases like bridges  midrange drink drivers  were convicted

so why should i not record a conviction in this case she asked considering there is a child in the car  which increases the objective seriousness of the case

this is a special case shes a rather special type of person mr bellanto said  drawing a sharp question from the magistrate

are you advancing there is a special tier of justice to a person who has a special standing in the community she asked

a middleaged man sitting in the public gallery muttered of course there is

if a person is a person of good character  its like money in the bank

bridges lawyer tony bellanto qc

but mr bellanto had a more eloquent answer  that bridges was of good character and that meant something in the justice system

if a person is a person of good character  its like money in the bank the law says youre entitled to draw on that

but ms hawkins said she was bound by law to balance a persons good character with the communitys expectation that actions come with consequences

mr bellanto  who was admitted as a lawyer in 1967  closed his submissions by drawing on the work of playwright william shakespeare

oftentimes excusing of a fault doth make the fault the worse by the excuse he said quoting the play the life and death of king john

the police prosecutor then only had one thing to say to the court was the magistrate considering not handing bridges a conviction

ms hawkins was blunt no im not she said and ordered the fitness guru to stand up

magistrate hawkins said she accepted bridges was genuinely remorseful

but she warned bridges that the fact she was going through a relationship breakdown would be cold comfort if she had she injured someone in an accident

she convicted bridges fined her 750 disqualified her licence for three months and ordered she install an alcohol interlock device on her car

bridges huddled with her supporters and then left the courtroom she was just another drink driver to pass through waverley court  but one nonetheless expected to make a tearful statement to the media

tearfully she told a media pack i would like to apologise to my family friends and community for this gross error in judgment she said

the consequences of these actions will haunt me forever

she then jumped into a waiting car

someone else was driving

michelle bridges begs for leniency for helping australians lose two million kilograms as she pleads guilty to drink driving after blowing 0086 in her range rover with her son 5 in the car

bridges said she was having a difficult time following her breakup commando together above when the incident occurred

former biggest loser star and celebrity trainer michelle bridges has pleaded guilty to drink driving

bridges 49 was convicted of the criminal offence in court on tuesday despite her legal team arguing she had a special case

the fitness guru blew 0086 when she was pulled over in her range rover with her fiveyearold son in the car at about 1125am on australia day as she drove through bellevue hill in sydneys eastern suburbs

but her legal representative tony bellanto qc argued she should not be convicted citing the millions of kilograms she has helped australians shed

over 10 years she is responsible for the australian public losing two million kilograms in weight mr bellatoni told the court during sentencing

now thats powerful  two million kilograms over ten years

a conviction would act as a scar on her record for the rest of her life  when in fact shes a good mother shes hardworking and this has had a most profound effect on her life he said

its a special case shes a special person

magistrate allison hawkins rebuked the submission saying are you advancing that there is a special tier of justice to a person who has special standing in the community

the magistrate said while she appreciated bridges had been humiliated the fact she had been going through a tough time would have been cold comfort to victims had she had an accident

how michelle bridhes claims she blew 0086 at 1125am

bridges claims it was four vodka sodas a glass of wine and a swirl of mouthwash that put her over the limit

in a police statement of facts officers said bridges was driving her son home from the beach at nielsen park when police her break suddenly and change lanes

derby county forward mason bennetts wait for his millwall debut is almost over

bennett left pride park stadium for a loan move to the lions  who also have an option to make the deal permanent  in january but he still hasnt featured through injury

the 23yearolds wait for his debut is almost over though according to millwall boss and former rams manager gary rowett

he trained on friday and got through it fine rowett told the south london press

he would have been involved in the fulham game had he not picked up a knock

it was a really innocuous challenge and it just rocked his ankle a little bit the ankle was a little swollen nothing serious

when you bring someone in on loan you want them to be involved  and i want mase to be involved and ready but it is like with lenny ryan leonard you put them in when they are ready  otherwise you are putting them on the bench and taking out somebody who can do something off the bench

if mase gets through this week okay then hell certainly be involved at the weekend

hes been really unfortunate the challenge was always going to be getting him fit

speaking previously about the drinkdriving incident which saw bennett sentenced during his time with the rams rowett added what i would say is that hes accepted that he has made mistakes

it is not something that i would condone or the club would condone but he has been punished for it

we are the type of club which is going to pick people up and rehabilitate them and get them back to what they are about ; chennai feb 18 ians southern actress sriya reddy is redefining fitness goals with a new gym video of herself

this is just what i needed thank you another instagram user wrote ; london feb 18 reuters  only a fraction of people who run do so because they love it and most are motivated by boosting their body image and improving their heart and mental health according to a global survey by the fitnesstracking app strava

strava which tracks the sports activity trends of some 50 million people in almost 200 countries surveyed 25000 runners and found that half of them say they either hate it or barely tolerate it while only 8 love it

but running is often connected with a sense of stability at a deeper level strava said in a report of the surveys findings runners described the need to run to maintain their sense of self and as a way to respond to adversity

theres a great realisation that to exercise the body also helps to exercise the mind  which is a muscle that needs just as much looking after as the other muscles said simon klima stravas global marketing director

and love it or hate it the vast majority of runners cited health as a primary motivator for getting out and clocking up the miles more than 80 said they started running to get healthier stronger or have more energy

in brazil 22 of amateur runners said theyd taken up the sport due to a health scare that compares with just 2 in the united states there almost half of respondents said building strength was a core motivator to run  and this was even higher  at 54  among us women

german runners were the most likely of the nations surveyed to cite body image as a reason to run  at 47  and in japan 15 say they run to combat feelings of anxiety and depression

klima sees this as a sign of the times with social media networks putting pressure on people for how they look its driving up the motivating factor of body image he said

the why we run survey  which included respondents from nine countries in north america south america asia and europe  showed how runners worldwide share many common traits

it clustered runners into five key types based on the benefits they value and the extent to which they race or run in social groups

they ranged from passionate runners who run in many social settings and reap the psychosocial benefits like accomplishment and happiness to mindful runners  who tend to run alone  to reluctant runners who rarely compete in races and perceive the fewest social or psychological benefits of all runner types

and while fad and fashion have driven numerous fluctuations in consumer interest in exercise a current tidal wave of fitnessfocused products is generating big interest  and bigger revenues  thanks in large part to a single new addition thats already earned our collective adoration

the screen

sure big screen tvs have plastered the walls in health clubs and fitness centers for years and smaller screens have long been attached to cardio equipment providing info like speed and duration for those walking stepping or pedaling their way to better health

but back in 2014 silicon valley startup peloton upped the ante by releasing a product that married a smart screen that features exclusive streaming content to a stationary bicycle that while modern isnt really so far removed from its 18th century progenitor

and the product has gone on to spawn an entirely new market for hightech fitness equipment worth hundreds of billions and even has a fresh utah startup looking to disrupt workout conventions

the key driver to pelotons success has been the power of its 22inch wifi enabled screen thanks to wildly popular classes that feature ultrafit instructors with big personalities that draw thousands of participants who can live monitor where they fit into the throngs thanks to ride data that streams to peloton servers one class on thanksgiving day last year drew a record 11000plus riders

the cost of this group experience the peloton bike will currently set you back 2245 and buyers are obligated to a oneyear subscription to the companys streaming service which adds 39 per month to the cost of riding ahead of a public stock offering last september the company claimed nearly 15 million subscribers of which 500000 were active users

that level of engagement described by one reviewer as a cultlike following has been parlayed into expansive financial success for peloton the company raised over 1 billion in its september 2019 stock offering and with a current stock value thats about 10 above its launch price puts peloton near an 8 billion market capitalization

university of utah professor of kinesiology traci thompson said its not just techsavvy millennials and gen zers that are being drawn into heightened fitness awareness thanks to ongoing innovations

i think the way technology has evolved in the wellness and fitness world has in a lot of ways made things widely available that used to be only accessible to people with disposable time and money thompson said individualized training programs and feedback coming directly to you not too long ago was information that was out of reach unless you could afford to see a personal trainer or have professional testing done

thompson said easy tools like fitness bands and smartphone software that monitors and tracks activity diet and even personal biometrics like heart rate and sleep cycle are in wide use span generational boundaries and have helped pave the way for a broader comfort with new advancements she noted the fitness interactivity elements that innovators like peloton have engineered were making experiences that were once the exclusive domain of health clubs now available in peoples homes

companies like peloton are providing you with something that not that long ago you would have only found at a class through your gym membership thompson said i think what theyre doing is interesting and  i understand the appeal

that appeal is well on the radars of a slew of enterprises that are working to bring that bigscreen interactivity into other fitness channels

the mirror touts itself as a home fitness trainer and as the name implies is a mirror and large vertical lcd screen sandwiched together like peloton purchase of the 1495 device requires a subscription contract that costs 39 per month the live and ondemand content from the company feature fitness trainers that appear on the screen and from whom users can visually match form for whatever exercise theyre engaging

tonals device goes for the same wallmounted vertical screen as mirror but also includes cable digital weights that are integrated via two arms attached to the sides of the screen cable resistance and position can be adjusted and workout instructors appear on screen to guide training sessions access to those workouts comes via a 49 per month subscription on top of the tonals 3000 retail price

and if you always wanted to join fight club but couldnt be bothered to leave the house fightcamp has just the solution sensors in a pedestalmounted punching bag and boxing gloves feed information to an interface that will evaluate and rate your workout youll have to provide your own screen for streaming lessons and instruction from a 39 per month subscription and the fightcamp full equipment package  which includes the smart bag hand wraps gloves and an exercise mat  will set you back 1995

utah startup true adherence is looking to elevate the combination of big screen interactivity and advanced fitness technology with a device that uses video cameras and onboard processing to see assess and correct weight training workouts in real time

university of utah graduate student and true adherence ceo kyle poulin has a background as a professional personal trainer and saw a path by which he could translate what he did for clients into a digitallydriven system

id seen the darker side of weight training where people didnt have a trainer and they got injured just because they were trying to get healthy poulin said i wanted to design a system that made sure people have proper form and technique and are actually enjoying the process

i started working on ideas focused on creating a way to make this more efficient with computer vision and other technologies that will actually allow people to have a safe and positive digital personal trainer experience

the pedestal mounted true adherence is another big vertical screen that displays workout data like reps and duration for the user who stands just a few feet in front of the device but whereas the other big screen workout systems just show an instructor to follow along with true adherence technology offers dozens of guided weight training workouts and uses its onboard cameras to see and analyze the user projecting them back as a sort of skeletal animation with colorcoded highlights showing how well or not your form is green lets you know youre on track but a red highlight coaxes you in real time to maintain your midline or stop abducting your right knee

poulin characterized the cardiofocused systems of companies like peloton and mirror as a merging of netflix with traditional exercises and equipment but true adherence is pushing for something more focused on individual improvement and advancement in the realm of resistance training

poulin and true adherence chief technology officer chris bright said upcoming realworld testing will be an opportunity to continue to finetune their system while they and their team continue to work on product development

veteran entrepreneur and executive director of the us lassonde entrepreneur institute troy dambrosio is working as a consultant with poulin and bright who are also students in the schools master of business creation program dambrosio said the company is on a unique innovation path

fitness is one of the latest industries to be disrupted by digital technologies dambrosio said companies are finding ways to use these technologies to make fitness more engaging and productive

true adherence  is a perfect example it is using feedback technology to help weightlifters improve their form this is creating a new experience that never existed before ; savannah prez put her physique on full display in some skintight pants for her latest instagram photo the belgian fitness model delighted her fans with the pic on sunday

speculation has swirled around regarding the fitness of perry after she was dropped down the batting line up to no 7 for their fivewicket win over sri lanka on monday compounded further when she arrived at perth airport the following day with strapping on her right shoulder

perry sustained a lowgrade ac joint injury in november last year when attempting a boundary catch for the sydney sixers in the wbbl

she took no further part in the wbbl after the sixers failed to make finals but returned for the triseries against india and england in early february

aussie captain meg lanning said her superstar righthanded batterbowler was a professional athlete who knew how to manage niggles well

obviously its something shes been managing since wbbl lanning said

but shes trained every time weve been out there training and shes played every game so its nothing thats going to keep her out of any games or anything like that shell train fully on wednesday

im sure there are a few players out in this competition who are managing injuries and shes a professional and deals with it really well so were not expecting anything major out of that

when asked whether there was a chance perry would be rested lanning simply replied no nup

lanning also addressed the changing batting order which has left some aussie fans scratching their heads especially when nicola carey was sent in above perry in mondays match against sri lanka

our top six batters could all open the batting so it really comes down to the matchups on the day and game situations and what we thinks going to work best she said

so weve gone with lefthandrighthand combinations a little bit and thats what we did the other night with nic carey coming in when rach haynes got out

ellyse is a worldclass player  weve just got to be really flexible and whatever the team needs were going to do

after recording their first win of the tournament on monday lanning said it was good kickstart for the rest of their t20 world cup campaign

obviously we have a new challenge coming up against bangladesh and we want to keep improving the way that were playing so its nice to get a win on the board she said

lanning said the fact that her side was able to grind out a tough win after slumping to 310 in their run chase at the waca was a positive

youve got to be able to fight your way through difficult periods hopefully weve started to do that and the next couple of games well improve on what we need to ; mumbai feb 26 socialnewsxyz bollywood actress and style diva kareena kapoor khan has shared her fitness secrets for fans

other than working out kareena strongly believes that a healthy attitude towards life and good food are the right tricks to stay healthy reports pinkvillacom

kareena who is nicknamed bebo shared that she starts her day by drinking a glass of hot water mixed with lime breakfast must include poha or upma

experienced prop brok harris is a doubt for the dragons guinness pro14 clash with toyota cheetahs at rodney parade this weekend

the south african suffered a pectoral injury during the 3419 defeat by glasgow warriors last saturday  it was the same day that harris turned 34

he was forced to leave the field towards the end of the first half at scotstoun stadium with wales international aaron jarvis replacing him for the remainder of the match

brok has an injury to his pectoral muscle which is a concern said dragons boss dean ryan

we will wait and see what the scan says but it is a potential big loss for us we dont know if he misses the game yet

hooker richard hibbard missed the defeat in scotland with a shoulder injury and on the wales and british  irish lions ace ryan added he is getting closer

he is around training now which is great to see but whether his return is this weekend or not were not sure yet

ryan was also asked if current wales squad members cory hill and elliot dee who have sat out the first three rounds of the six nations through injury could be made available for saturdays game

he said i dont think either are ready to play theyre certainly not available for this weekend

meanwhile ryan said the region had heard nothing from the pro14 about whether the home fixture against benetton next friday could be in doubt over coronavirus

he said we havent heard that its obviously only sporting gatherings in italy so well plan for the game going ahead well wait and see what happens next

it is frustrating for us because we were unhappy to lose that game when it was postponed earlier this month due to the weather

i know weather conditions were poor but we were unhappy because of how early the decision was made

were in europe and to play for what will effectively be 14 weeks on the bounce with a pretty small squad will obviously have an impact on us

theres obviously bigger things at play than whether we get a game against benetton

lets just see what people in higher positions than me decide about whether teams are travelling or not ; belgian fitness model savannah prez likely sent some hearts aflutter among her instagram followers on tuesday when uploaded a photo of herself in which she rocked some skintight jeans the fitted pants showed off the models chiseled quads thanks to a couple of strategically placed rips she paired the jeans with a loosefitting light brown buttonup shirt that she tucked into her pants she also sported heavy duty black and brown combats boots savannah wore her hair down as she posed in front of her mirror for the selfie and appeared to wear subtle naturallooking makeup to accentuate her beauty

jen didnt include a geotag on her video that revealed the location but she appeared to be in a tropical paradise jen stood on a balcony or patio with completely clear glass sides that overlooked a stunning view of lush green palm trees the ocean was visible in the background with white frothy waves crashing against the blue water

jen had one hand on the edge of the balcony and the other started out tucking a strand of hair behind her ear before she crossed her chest and struck a pose for the camera the bikini jen wore in the video was a simple stringstyle with triangular cups that clung to her pert assets and simple strings that tied around her back and neck for a revealing look

the bikini bottoms jen wore were likewise super skimpy the front consisted of little more than a tiny triangle of fabric and the back was a super cheeky style that almost qualified as a thong given how much of her gravitydefying derriere was on display the bottoms dipped low in the front to reveal plenty of jens chiselled stomach and she posed barefoot showing off every inch of her incredible legs

jens long brunette locks hung down in a straight style and she accessorized with a simple choker necklace and a pair of rosecolored sunglasses a blendjet portable blender was placed on the balcony near her in a vibrant shade of turquoise

in addition to the posts in which she simply shows off her curves jen often shares short video clips demonstrating several workout moves for her followers just yesterday as the inquisitr reported jen posted a video in which she rocked a tight athletic ensemble as she went through a workout including bootybuilding moves like the squat hold with rotation ; it doesnt matter whether you are an oftflying business sort who spends more days in a marriott than your own bed or a mother of two enjoying a family vacation regardless hotel gyms are often lacking which makes fitness on the go stressful at best and nonexistent at worst seriously who wants to cram an entire workout on a cable machine

fortunately the fitness pros have heard our pleas these days there is a gaggle of training gear available for the frequent flyers among us who dont want to always go for a run as someone who spends quite a few nights slumbering in random hotels around the world ive tested all of this gear myself and i promise itll help you break a sweat regardless of whether youre in a hotel room a random parking lot a quiet lobby in an airport or even your own basement

trx is the granddaddy of onthego fitness at first glance it looks like a couple of straps with handles but once you get the hang of it you can use your bodyweight to nab a total workout plus all you need is a door to anchor the system and you are good to go the straps pack up small enough to fit into a suitcase and the weight is negligible your lunch likely weighs more

i bought this for my husband this past christmas and ill admit i gulped when i saw the price 150 for a backpack but it turns out that the empack was a great investment for him and me since i also use it designed by mtv reality queen emily schromm the pack uses a series of bladders that you fill with water to add weight each bladder weighs up to 15 pounds and the pack can hold four bladders from there the sky is the limit squats deadlifts push presses shoulder presses turkish getups  the list goes on i use the pack itself as my carryon during flights and the bladders easily stash away in my luggage

back in the day when i was a triedandtrue crossfitter i tried a barre class thinking the small movement would be easy turns out joke was on me and i was sore for a week these exercise sliders have the same effect they slide on all surfaces but you have to engage your muscles to guide the direction pro tip try simple movements like mountain climbers pikeups or lunges and report back i bet youre hurting

in the first grade jumping rope was a fun recess activity to enjoy with your friends as an adult its a cardio workout originating in the seventh circle of hell not only does it engage every muscle in your legs but im willing to be youll be panting within three minutes if you want to kick your session into overdrive give some doubleunders a try the rope passes beneath your feet twice before you land that ought to ramp things up a bit

these 100 natural latex bands will crank the burn before you know it this set includes four bands of varying resistance and a small travel bag so you can easily create a workout within your abilities depending on what youre after you can use the band to create either resistance or assistance for example if you want to work on your pullups loop a band around the bar and put your foot into the bottom for added support for resistance monster walk across the room with a band looped around your ankles burn baby burn

we all know we should foam roll daily but is anyone actually doing it up your rolling game postworkout by packing this travel roller in your suitcase its smaller dimensions 45inch diameter make it easy to stow away but its hollow core also allows you to stash sundries like socks and underwear inside so there isnt any wasted space added bonus if airplane seats wreak havoc on your back this is the cure ; in the recently published report stats and reports research has provided a unique insight into the global home fitness equipment market for the forecasted period of 6 years 20192025 the report has covered the significant aspects that are contributing to the growth of the global home fitness equipment market the primary objective of this report is to highlight the various key market dynamics such as drivers trends and restraints that are impacting the global home fitness equipment market this report has provided an indication to the readers about home fitness equipment markets current status

trulieve 72 hour deadline alert former louisiana attorney general and kahn swick  foti llc remind investors with losses in excess of 100000 of deadline in class action lawsuit against trulieve cannabis corp  tcnnf ; mayweather boxing  fitness announced today its downtown chicago location will open on march 14 at 219 whubbard street

chicago is a key market for the fitness industry and our new studio is positioned perfectly both geographically and conceptually to appeal to the dynamic fitness community there said james williams ceo of mayweather boxing  fitness the grand opening will kick off with boxing group fitness classes led by our seasoned trainers who have been handselected and trained through our mayweather boxing  fitness coach certification it will continue with events throughout the day to engage the local community with the brand and for members and guests to experience the quality and fun of the workout

sara mcspedon experienced in both business operations and in building successful multilocation enterprises in chicago will meld her love of boxing and entrepreneurial energy spirit to lead the chicago studio she was awarded five territories in the chicago area and is growing her mayweather footprint to provide multiple location options to its residents

i am beyond thrilled to bring together a community dedicated to health wellness and results said mcspedon the franchise executive team the concept programming marketing and retail are all spot on and i look forward to representing the brand and leading this new fitness concept to success

the studio has signed up more than 250 members to date prior to opening day ; differences in health policy werent the only bones presidential candidates had to pick last week they also sparred over details of their personal health and with the next debate and super tuesday primaries fast approaching these skirmishes are likely to escalate

in the runup to the las vegas democratic presidential primary faceoff vermont sen bernie sanders national press secretary briahna joy gray told cnn that opponents are trying to use his october heart attack against him then she mistakenly claimed that mike bloomberg has suffered heart attacks in the past  a statement she quickly walked back after a bloomberg adviser said in a tweet it was a trumpy lie

he did not have a heart attack bloombergs camp explained trying to differentiate its candidates health status he had stents the former new york mayor according to the campaign had coronary stents inserted two decades ago after a cardiac test indicated they might be useful

feathers still ruffled the two candidates went at it again on the debate stage

i think the one area maybe that mayor bloomberg and i share you have two stents as well sanders said thursday to his rival onstage

bloomberg responded twentyfive years ago

its not surprising with the oldest crop ever of presidential candidates that their vital signs are becoming a talking point

when it comes to politics personal health is just one more issue to try and leverage said arthur caplan a professor of bioethics at nyu school of medicine in new york city

that got us wondering how this information fits into the facts voters weigh and in evaluating a candidates longterm health or electability does it really matter whether a patient got a stent as part of treatment for a heart attack like sanders or for another reason such as to relieve chest pain or following a cardiac stress test like bloomberg

in this day and age with the way technology has advanced and the skill sets of the cardiologists i would say they are practically the same we expect good results for both said dr hadley wilson a practicing cardiologist in charlotte north carolina and a member of the american college of cardiologys board of trustees

stents are almost always used when a person is having a heart attack

heart attacks can occur when plaque breaks off inside the blood vessels of the heart causing a blockage to open the blocked artery physicians insert stents which are small wiremesh tubes afterward patients are treated with medications to reduce the risk of subsequent heart attacks

back when bloomberg got his they were commonly used in nonemergency situations to prop open narrowing arteries with the thought that might prevent a heart attack said dr suzanne steinbaum a cardiologist in new york and a spokesperson for the american heart association

but since then we learned stents dont prevent a heart attack and that using medication might be equally beneficial steinbaum said adding that the best preventive measures are lifestyle choices such as eating a good diet exercising and not smoking patients still sometimes get stents to alleviate symptoms such as chest pain or for other reasons

thursdays debate also highlighted the broader question just how much of a candidates medical history is fair game for public consumption

sanders who faced criticism in october for delays in reporting his condition said he has since released the full report of that heart attack  including letters from his primary care doctor and two cardiologists attesting to his overall health and recovery

but candidate pete buttigieg the former mayor of south bend indiana said sanders had not provided enough detail  and neither he said had the others

under president obama the standard was that the president would release full medical records do a physical and release the readout he said during the debate now president trump lowered that standard he said just a letter from a doctor is enough and a lot of folks on this stage are now saying thats enough

buttigieg himself has yet to provide a full medical record

but i am certainly prepared to get a physical put out the results he said during the debate i think everybody here should be willing to do the same

some observers agree theres no such thing as tmi too much information when it comes to potus the president of the united states

when the country is hiring someone to have their finger on the nuclear button the expectation of personal privacy is very very limited said david blumenthal head of the commonwealth fund and coauthor of the heart of power health and politics in the oval office its hard to imagine something that would not be relevant

that argument though doesnt always hold up

when he ran for president in 2008 the then70yearold sen john mccain released more than 1000 pages of his medical records

by contrast the campaigning donald trump initially released a glowing letter from his personal physician that concluded he would be the healthiest individual ever elected to the presidency after criticism that the letter lacked specifics trump added information on his height weight and cholesterol levels and went on to become the oldest president at age 70 to take office beating out ronald reagan who was just weeks shy of that milestone on inauguration day in 1981

this year candidates bloomberg and sanders are both 78 former vice president joe biden 77 and sen elizabeth warren 70 sen amy klobuchar is 59 and buttigieg is the youngest at 38

anything that might be relevant to a candidates ability and competence to govern and their longevity of service should be disclosed said blumenthal who is also a medical doctor

voters could then decide what they thought was important the information might also affect how voters view the choice of a vice president especially if the candidate for the highest office had a serious illness or something else that might limit their term he said

specifically which records though and how to release them is a complicated issue

caplan at nyu has long advocated setting up a special independent medical panel to evaluate presidential candidates health  and make their findings public

it would be like an executive physical which is what a lot of companies do before they pick a ceo he said

and deciding what to test for would be in itself complicated without a special panel  which even caplan admits would meet political inertia  the challenges would be numerous even locating all the necessary records would be difficult

the candidates may have moved around the country their doctors may have died or records may not be available noted lawrence altman who covered many presidential elections as a reporter for the new york times and is now a global scholar at the woodrow wilson international center for scholars

while there is no specific requirement that candidates release any information at all what readers  and voters  want to know varies widely

it depends on their interest in the candidate altman said a lot of people superimpose their political choices or feelings on the medical aspect they are willing to dismiss something if they really like the candidate or make a big issue about it if they dont like the candidate ; as certain brands have learned the hard way  via things like 150 million lawsuits  licensing music in the world of fitness marketing is a very specific process orangetheory fitness  a company that hosts highimpact workouts in over 1300 studio locations around the world has been proactively spending the past two years on a rightscompliant music strategy that fairly compensates creators  and more recently includes its first foray into original music with dancemusic duo krewella  who will headline the brands hypothesis activation at south by southwest on march 14

we love and appreciate what artists bring to the table for orangetheory and the experience says kevin keith the companys chief brand officer who says of rights clearances the last thing i want to be dealing with is a multimilliondollar licensing lawsuit weve spent the last two years working negotiating and deploying a new music solution that really elevates the music experience and at the same time provides a structure to keep us compliant globally it can be a complicated thing for anyone to navigate especially when their primary role is not running a music business but we have developed a solution that will make it a lot easier to keep us rightscompliant so were not in the headlines for the wrong reasons  and keeping our community fitter and stronger

to help execute this twopronged approach to music orangetheory tapped strategic partners like the music divisions joe belliotti former head of global music at cocacola to oversee its licensing strategy and red lights matt ringel for a partnership with the management firms clients krewella the sister duo behind the 2013 top 40 hit alive crafted an original song the anthemic  greenlights  for orangetheorys 2020 branding campaign and ended up liking it so much that its the lead single from their newly released second album zer0

usually with partnerships company just pick a song thats already finished that sits well with their brand says krewellas yasmine yousaf but orangetheory commissioned us to make a song from scratch and sent us a rough cut of the commercial to use as inspiration it just so happened it was the last song we wrote as we were making the album and we loved it so much we felt that it fit in well with the sonic landscape and other songs it was so much fun to create from a place of what can krewella bring to the table and not stick to specific guidelines other than sticking to a certain bpm

adds jahan yousaf krewellas colead member and yasmines sister we were honored that orangetheory came to us and trusted that we could make highenergy melodic inspiring music that could be used to motivate people to move their bodies and work out

since the campaigns debut in late december orangetheorys keith says consumer feedback has been strong  particularly among the brands unusually large reddit community of 100000 users everyone just felt the song resonated with their experience from my perspective success and kpis key performance indicators come when we become a symbol of vibrant living and positivity and i think music has played a critical role in that the feedback from social and our members has exceeded expectations

the krewella partnership will come to life as part of orangetheorys 4day hypothesis activation at austins fair market during south by southwest on saturday march 15 where the duo will perform a part djpart live set including greenlights

music is central to the workout experience says keith weve been thinking about how to take that out of the studio and put it into our marketing so people take away that feeling you get well be taking over an 18000 sqaurefoot warehouse in downtown austin and really putting the orangetheory experience to the test and giving people a peek behind the curtain at our science its an opportunity to showcase krewella and our brand anthem and give people a memorable experience

i need muscles like this another instagram user commented ; montreal  head coach thierry henry was the first to admit that his montreal impact team did not have the fitness level to match that of deportivo saprissa in their concacaf champions league clash last week

they didnt have 90 minutes in them henry said everybody knew its not an excuse its a fact

henry gave credit to saprissa and their head coach walter centeno for how they played in the second half the frenchman said that his counterpart changed tactical formations four times during the game in order to help his team get the 22 firstleg draw

montreal midfielder samuel piette admitted that saprissas tactical changes surprised them a little bit since the impact have not been able to bridge the fitness gap between both clubs in a single week piette said henry focussed on tactics

this week we worked on the possibilities that we could be facing on wednesday if theres a change in the scoreline piette said i think that this is how well be able to make up for the lack of fitness on our side

the impact started the first leg in spectacular fashion scoring two early goals henrys squad can attribute the early success to their fiveman backline which was unseen until last wednesday after the impact coach admitted to not having a great preseason the tactical change helped his squad get an early result

theres something that wasnt working in preseason you dont have to be that clever to see that it wasnt working henry said you also need to see what the team is offering you and how they respond

so we went that way and it worked out at the beginning because it surprised them i think are we going to play the same way wednesday i cant answer that

the impact are back home at olympic stadium with a 22 scoreline and two important away goals for montreal native piette it is imperative that his squad do not defend for 90 minutes to keep a 00 draw

its delicate but the most important will be not to be only defending for 90 minutes piette said for one its very tough physically and secondly when its been 10 or 15 minutes that you havent had the ball you tend to lose your confidence on the ball

the impact will also host their mls season opener on saturday when they take on the new england revolution 3 pm et  mls live on espn in the us tvas in canada for saphir taider having the first game of the season on the back of their minds will not affect how they play in the ccl

its not because were not favorites to win the ccl that we need to think of it as a bonus taider said we need to play this competition with a desire to win and to go all the way the team did it five years ago so why not this year

its modern football its the football of today where games follow each other and we need to do it too and play every three days its part of our jobs so its not really a problem

as for henry being available to play  even on a twogame week  is whats expected of a soccer player

theyre here to be able to play and whoever is going to be fit to play is going to be at our disposal to start the game against new england henry said thats what you expect from your team whatever game it is

however henry added that he will delay his thought process for saturdays formation until the final whistle of wednesdays ccl affair

for me there is a sense of urgency in every game henry said now does it have an influence on how were going to play against new england i can only tell at the end of the game because i didnt expect that we would lose two players in the first 27 minutes of our first game thats something that you cannot predict lets see how well finish the game against saprissa ; michie peachie served up another dose of fitspiration to her one million instagram followers this week the popular fitness trainer took to her account on wednesday to share a set of instructional videos that demonstrated a booty burn routine for her fans to try

the set of four clips saw michie working up a sweat in a large gym she wore a coordinated set of blue athletic wear from bombshell sportswear for the demonstration which she labeled a booty shaping outfit in the caption of her post she also wore a pair of chunky tan sneakers and tied her long brunette hair up in a ponytail that sat high on top of her head

michie kicked off her rigorous workout routine with a set of sumo squats using the smith machine she stood with her toned legs spread wide apart and her toes pointed outward and slowly began squatting down while keeping her back straight

the next step in the models workout was a set of threequarter squats with band abductions which she performed at the same machine she dipped down into a squat position and did an abductor move by pushing her hips apart she then returned almost to her starting position but noted in the caption of her post that she was only going part of the way up as the focus for this exercise was the squat resistance range

michie then performed a set of reverse hypers on a reverse hyper machhine she wrapped her arms around a set of bars in front of her and laid stomachdown across the machine while slowly lifting her legs up in the air behind her

the final step in the trainers booty burn routine was a set of hyper pulses she again laid across the machine though this time secured her feet in the bars and bent her upper body toward the floor while gripping a weight slowly michie began lifting herself up so that her entire body was straight before driving back down into her starting position

3 common glute related questions  can you train glutes more than 1 time per week yes glutes are a big muscle and can handle volume  frequency if you are wanting to grow and bring up a body part you need to bias this with your training glutes also respond best to variety so that means hitting them with differing rep ranges tempos  exercise selection i have many of my girls on my programs hitting them 3 times per week  how to isolate glutes if you are quad dominant all exercises to some degree still activate leg muscles however with your training you could avoid exercise you feel highly engage your quads and focus more on exercises that activate glutes some example exercises would be glute bridges abductor machine rdls cable pull through single leg glue bridges side lying clams feet elevated glute bridges also focus on technique over weight if you increase the weight too quickly you may lose that glute connection  stronger muscles take over  best cardio for glutes my advice ditch the cardio if you are serious about building your glutes too many of you girls are focusing on purely cardio as your main focus in the gym and leaving no attention on the weights room by having a well designed training program around building muscle and with progressive overload it will see you get far greater results with your body composition than cardio will ever do for you it will create shape  that strong feminine bikini body shape   power booty program sale  ending soon my biggest sale ever on my glute training program  home  gym nutrition ebook  supplements  all part of the sale dont miss it babes  hit link in bio now build your best glutes laurensimpson

there are so many benefits of play for adults including stress relief improved brain function and improved social skills plus playing often gets you moving

between video games specifically designed to increase exercise to mobile apps that get you outside the link between gaming and fitness is stronger than you might think lets look at some of those intersections and how you can take part in the gamification of fitness to reach your health goals

geocaching is still a relatively new activity first introduced in the year 2000 the word geo is used to describe geography around the planet while cache a french word introduced in 1797 refers to a hiding place used to temporarily keep items when geocaching first began it was limited to those who were already familiar with gps technology now 20 years after its launch its a fun activity for kids and adults alike that can make you feel like a real treasure hunter there are even games specifically dedicated to geocaching designed to get kids out of the house and into nature

there are currently over 3 million geocaches hidden around the world all you need is a gps device and one of the apps or websites dedicated to the geocaches it can also help to bring hunting supplies with you like a small trowel or shovel a container for your finds and a metal detector to help you locate geocaches underneath brush trees etc

it doesnt take long to get really invested in this treasurehunting hobby which allows you to spend more time outside hiking and walking through different types of terrain you can even get really creative and use a drone to take pictures or video of the gps locations youre looking for making the spots easier to find from a distance

the pokemon go app was released on july 6 2016 and was an instant hit for fans of the original game and even those who had never been introduced to pokemon before the app uses virtual reality technology to put pokemon characters into the real world through the screen of your smartphone allowing you to catch them in different locations

while the technology used in the game was revolutionary at the time and made for a great source of entertainment pokemon go had some unexpected benefits for users too one study found that over a period of 30 days active users of the game added about 1473 steps a day to their typical routine  just by hunting characters the great thing about that is that pokemon go and other virtual world games appeal to everyone  not just those who are already into health and fitness and may already wear fitness trackers or use healthrelated apps

of course there are drawbacks to locationbased games like these they need to keep the attention of users and keep adding fresh content to stay relevant in the case of pokemon go the drop in usage is significant in september 2016 there were over 500 million pokemon go downloads worldwide since those first few weeks after its launch its continued to have a core following but hasnt garnered the same interest

though pokemon go is undoubtedly the most popular virtual world app to launch thus far these types of apps and programs are being used for a variety of health and wellness issues including healthcare education and simulation

the term gamification is often used in the business sector or by marketers it adds incentive to buying certain products or completing certain tasks by offering various rewards loyalty programs are a great example of gamification in business if you sign up for one and you get a discount or reward after spending a certain amount of money that business is using the idea of gamification to influence your buying habits

in the world of fitness the basic idea is no different thats one of the reasons why health apps have become increasingly popular as of 2018 there were almost 320000 fitness and health apps available for users to download

most health apps specialize in things like

if you have a fitness goal in mind chances are theres an app that can help you to reach it these apps are instantlyaccessible give you realtime information and can hold you accountable no matter what health goals youre trying to achieve

many of them also use the gamification technique to keep you motivated such as the couch to 5k app that creates a running program for you designed to help you work your way up toward running a 5k it tracks your progress each day offers different running distances each day and offers an end goal thats the ultimate reward of satisfaction

technology and gaming dont always have to coincide with sitting on the couch eating greasy snacks its time to change the way we think about gaming and fitness and utilize more of the resources that can make staying in shape fun for everyone ; googles wearos has historically struggled to be a worthy competitor to apples watchos or samsungs tizen os after buying fitbit back in november 2019 we expected google to health and fitness functionalities into wearos eventually now google has been asking feedback via a google user experience research program on possible new features for future versions of wearos

the survey asked participants on various health tracking features such as sleep metrics to sp02 tracking to automatic detection of a variety of categories to pairing with medical equipment while this does not confirm that google will add these features into the next version of wearos the very fact that google is taking such an interest is good many users use smartwatches mainly as fitness trackers and it would be welcoming to have these features baked right into wearos ; a glamourous fitness model has been charged by police after allegedly supplying 300g of cocaine in a sophisticated drug ring

investigations are continuing ; sarfaraz khan and his one and only coach his father mr naushad are concentrating at only one tournament at a time

for the second time in two seasons domestic powerhouse mumbai could not make it to the quarterfinals of the ranji trophy and it is for the fourth consecutive season that the trophy eluded the 41time champions mumbai won only a solitary game this season while drawing as many as eight they could not tick off most their boxes but among a few positives with which they can plan their road ahead sarfaraz khan tops the list

mumbai finished 13th on the points table but if not for khans onslaught of runs in the latter half of the group stage the khadoos army could have finished their 201920 campaign much more disastrously the 22yearold did not play the first two games of the season  against baroda and railways  due to the availability of senior players ajinkya rahane made only 13 runs against railways while aditya tare bettered the india vicecaptains tally by five runs all that while khan was serving drinks to them

it was only after some of the senior players became unavailable that sarfaraz khan featured in the xi what followed was a storm of runs the 360degree batsman started off with a halfcentury against karnataka followed by an unbeaten 301 against uttar pradesh this was followed by a 226 not out against himachal pradesh 78 versus saurashtra and another 177 in the last game against madhya pradesh

by the end of the group stage matches khan had accumulated 928 runs in only nine innings with an average of 15466 the best this season as on february 22

in 201516 sarfaraz khan left mumbai to join the uttar pradesh team upon his father and coach naushad khans insistence but he didnt get many opportunities in the new team which eventually prompted him to return to the city of dreams three seasons later

only people in the up team will be able to tell you why they were not giving sarfaraz enough opportunities we went there to play but nobody told us why we didnt deserve to play mr naushad tells crictracker

the lack of chances made the junior khan go back to the azad maidan cross maidan and most importantly the wankhede stadium in 2018 the khans returned to mumbai but sarfaraz had to serve a oneyear coolingoff period before he could resume professional cricket at home

i wanted to go back home i won so many trophies for mumbai as a kid this is where i began my professional career the righthander reminiscences while speaking to crictracker happy that i am back home mumbai are 41time champions so it feels even more special to be their highest runscorer this season

during the cooling period sarfaraz khan was barred from playing professional cricket for a year but he took a positive out of it during my coolingoff period i got to know myself better what my aims are where i want to go what i want to do so in a way it is good that i got to give time to myself and i worked very hard

mr naushad who has been his sons one and only coach throughout explains how lack of opportunities in redball cricket contributed to sarfarazs slow growth as a firstclass batsman

most tournaments that sarfaraz played were whiteball tournaments even the ipl was whiteball cricket he played very little test cricket this is why he couldnt differentiate between the kind of batting each format needs  be it ipl or 50 overs or first class he used to end up with the same kind of strokes across formats

this is one area we worked hard on i made him understand that in whites he has to stay on the wicket for as long as possible bat as per the sessions wait for the loose balls and leave the spin balls we worked hard on all of this mr naushad explains he also emphasizes on the fact that the emergence of an improved sarfaraz came through a long process of hard work

in the buildup to the ranji trophy this year sarfaraz played a couple of redball tournaments he played the ksca tournament in bangalore in which he made two successive centuries then there was a tournament in mumbai where he hit a century he scored a century in another redball tournament too so it was a long process to see sarfaraz 20 nothing happened overnight

however the performance analyst of the mumbai team saurabh walkar feels that sarfaraz khan was never a poor batsman but lack of fitness made him look like one sarfaraz was always talented i am seeing him since his under14 days he is hardworking and can practice for 10 hours a day

he was the most talented among the group of boys in the under14 team talent can take you places but to sustain talent in cricket you need fitness which was missing explains walkar

royal challengers bangalore dropped sarfaraz in 2016 due to lack of fitness captain virat kohli made it clear that no fitness would mean no place in the playing xi it was at this moment when the youngster vouched to become a fitter athlete

i have improved my fitness to quite an extent but need to improve even more fitness reflects in the batting the very reason i could score tripledigit runs this season is because i felt fitter says sarfaraz who was nicknamed panda by people for being unfit

the ipl and the bcci need you to pass the yoyo test about which you must be aware and sarfaraz has been doing that the board itself provides with good trainers and nutritionists mr naushad says

mumbai captain suryakumar yadav also joins in the conversation acknowledging sarfaraz khans hard work on improving fitness after coming back to mumbai and during the coolingoff period sarfaraz worked hard on his fitness he worked on his batting too and just waited for an opportunity to play for mumbai again

and he knew that he has to get as many runs as possible whenever he gets an opportunity in absence of so many players he knew this is the best time for him to cement his place in the side make a mark play a few impact strokes and he did all of this in few games he played a blinder of an innings

i think the grit determination and hard work that he put the last one year is paying off right now i hope he continues doing what he has been doing i dont think he is doing anything different from the others hes just being smart he knows his game really well and he is also been reading the situations really well that is more important i feel this is just the start and we need to remember the name sarfaraz khan

as far as ipl 2020 is concerned neither sarfaraz khan nor his father is thinking about it the duo believes in taking each tournament at a time and not thinking too far ahead

i think the mistake we made earlier was that we planned for the whole year at once this messes things up ipl is still far away beginning on march 29 right now we want to concentrate on the immediate next assignment sarfaraz will be playing an under23 game soon so we are preparing for that at the moment

we also prepare as per the pitches if the matches are in tamil nadu we prepare to bat against spin bowling if the game is on a green top we prepare for the swinging deliveries so it is all about one match at a time that way you remain tension free too

when sarfaraz was asked if he is hopeful of being selected for the irani cup he echoed his fathers perspective saying that he just wants to take it one tournament at a time i am not thinking about the irani cup i think about one day at a time right now i am doing my daily practice i practice at the azad maidan and we have made a wicket at home too as for the ipl it is a big tournament and i hope i can contribute to the team the macho signs off ; googles wear os has a bad rap in the tech industry mostly for the lack of software innovation that makes the platform seem stagnant while most people dont see the benefit of owning a smartwatch wear os is not doing the category any favors its simply not on the level of other wearable operating systems from companies like samsung and apple

with the japanese league halted kimanzi feared the strikers fitness levels would drop but olunga told nation sport that his team is training as usual only that fans are now not allowed in to watch the sessions

we are training outdoor only that its closed training with no fans in attendance like the norm my opinion is that in terms of health i think its a good move by the government because its trying to protect its people from the deadly virus though it will slow down the momentum the league had taken olunga said

close to 83000 cases of the deadly virus have been reported worldwide with 2810 deaths confirmed as at thursday the virus which started in wuhan province in china has claimed 2800 people in the country although unconfirmed reports suggest it could be more than that south korea follows with 1595 confirmed cases and 12 deaths while japan is third

olunga was the second best top scorer in the japanese second tier last season as he netted 27 goals to guide kashiwa reysol back into the j1 league he scored two and assisted one as the team won their first match on their return to the top flight a 42 win over consadole sapporo last saturday ; the band will be made available in yellow black and green colour options

a local disabilities fitness group has added its weight to calls to save a popular perth gym

the group meets every wednesday morning at fit4less gym on canal street and gives locals with learning sensory and physical disabilities the chance to get active and work on their fitness

however plans have been submitted to perth and kinross council to demolish the gym and build six flats

nearly 1000 people have signed a petition against the plan and now the inclusive fitness group has added its voice

neil mcfadden from the group was so upset when he heard about the plans he even drew a campaign poster for the gym to use

he said i come here every wednesday and i like to go on the bikes and the running machines

i am upset it might close

i feel worried i would not be able to come to the gym and see the friends i have made here

i dont know what i would do if we didnt come to the gym i would be upset

fellow group member scott phillips said coming to the classes on a wednesday helps keep his heart beating

he said i like this gym i can do my exercises like running squats push ups and weights

all my friends are here and the instructors are fantastic

i am glad i have met them all

we work hard and train hard here to make the exercises perfect

going to the gym is good for my fitness it keeps my heart beating and strength in my muscles

if i didnt come to the gym i would just stay in and do nothing and that is no good we would much rather be doing this than standing about doing nothing

and david eggo said i come every wednesday to keep fit

i like to go down on the mats and go on the rowing machine and i have made new friends here so i look forward to coming

i am happy here i dont know what i would do if i didnt come here

i know all the instructors here and my fitness is better now

meanwhile christopher simpson said every week i come here to go on the treadmill cross trainer and bikes  i enjoy everything here

i have friends here and i look forward to seeing them  i would be sad if the gym closed

and stewart christie said i like to go on the bikes when i come here

i have made lots of friends here so i am quite happy to stay here

my fitness is better now as well

tammy fleuchar manager of fit4less perth said if the gym closes down there would be nowhere else for the group to go

she said over the past two years the group has grown in confidence

speaking to the pa she said my colleague siobhans brother chris has downs syndrome and he used to come in and train with her and then he started coming into our classes

that is the way he grew up there were no barriers

we then started chatting if there is this barrier how do we break it down

there was nowhere else for chris to go

i know some people get very concerned about people with additional support needs because there is a lack of knowledge and they dont know how to support them

there is a real community vibe in the class here  a lot of them have social anxiety and it has taken a long time for them to get the level of confidence they have now

they know straight away to go on the cardio machines to warm up and they know they need to keep themselves active and healthy

there are no other fitnessbased activities that we know off for them in perth and kinross  there are sports groups but fitness is very different and not everyone wants to do sport

they all push themselves really hard we do yoga boxing and weights with them stuff they wouldnt normally get to do

they have all excelled their dedication is brilliant

she continued the planning application appeals need to be in by today friday february 28 and then the council will take two or three weeks to decide whether to accept it or not

hopefully the landlord and the council can see community services like this are needed

lorraine gilzean is a support worker at kinnoull day opportunities and brings a group to the gym every wednesday

she said it is important they are kept in a routine and are given the opportunity to socialise with other people

she said they get to meet friends from other areas which is really important to make sure they are not living in a bubble

routine is really paramount to some of the individuals if you break their routine it could take weeks before they settle down

the staff here are really good with them as well they actually know all their names they are not just people who come to the gym they genuinely know who they are which makes such a difference

the planning application to demolish the gym and build flats in its place is currently being considered by perth and kinross council ; q ive wanted to take up boxing for fitness and fat loss for some time however watching deontay wilder stagger about and bleed profusely from his ear has made me question whether theres any method in the madness of boxing

as down step up their drive to gain promotion to division two of the allianz league kilcoo are also eyeing an eighth county championship crown in nine years and the addition of the versatile doherty to their ranks has been hailed as a bonus

and with darragh ohanlon having returned from australia and completed his rehabilitation following a cruciate injury both kilcoo and down could be in for a further fillip

kilcoo chairman terry ohanlon who is also darraghs father believes that the return of the two players could scarcely be more opportune

it was very encouraging to see ceilum getting some game time for down against longford said ohanlon snr

we would expect that he will be in the frame for the game with cork this sunday

the kilcoo chairman feels that his clubs surge into the allireland club final has triggered further interest in football at grassroots level within the county

its particularly encouraging to see the number of down fans who are travelling to away games he pointed out they are helping to give the players a lift and are creating further interest in the teams progress

i think down football has been given a lift because of kilcoo reaching the allireland club final everyone will want to play you and beat you if they can and the challenge for us as a club in particular is to see how we can best handle this challenge

we will continue to try and bring in young players like shealan johnston aaron morgan and justin clarke and if they can go on to make it with down then thats great

they are fighting to stay in our team as well as battling for regular recognition with down and thats the way it should be it all reflects well on down football at the end of the day and thats the main thing ; football association of malawi fam president walter nyamilandu says the association will introduce a physical fitness trainers course with the aim of having a qualified physical trainer in all the super league teams in the country

speaking during the opening of a refresher coaching course for super league head coaches at fams mpira house in chiwembeblantyre nyamilandu said the course will also be of great advantage to former players who will be using their qualification in securing a job for themselves

we are evolving from an era where if a player retires from football their only hope is to become a coach but this time we can see goalkeeper trainers dieticians physicians and so are physical fitness trainers

so this course will help retired players in creating jobs for themselves like opening gyms or even being employed by clubs nyamilandu said

nyamilandu added that the course would assist solve physical fitnessrelated problems that require special attention from specialists unlike coaches who are not experts in physical fitness

these specialised physical trainers will be able to know the right time for a player who is recovering from an injury to start endurancetesting match and best physical fitness exercise which coaches do not recognise said nyamilandu

nyamilandu therefore urged the super league head coaches to adapt to the new strategies and developments the game of football has evolved into

technologies used today are not like those which we used to have in the past hence the need for all our coaches to evolve to the new improved strategies and embrace the change that is more advanced he said follow and subscribe nyasa tv  ; updates on jonathan hogg trevoh chalobah emile smith rowe and chris willock after the 21 championship win

danny cowley has issued an update on the fitness of four of his huddersfield town players after a hardfought and muchdeserved 21 win over playoff contenders bristol city

jonathan hoggs injury status was top of the agenda postmatch after he limped off in the first half with a knee injury

cowley said i thought he started the game really well and gave us real aggression and got us on the front foot

but he got a kick in the achilles and then he got a whack on the knee it takes a lot for hoggy to come off he was a loss for sure but i thought trevoh chalobah came on and did well

hoggy was quite positive when i spoke to him so we will have to wait and see

chalobah himself then received some attention after the final whistle with towns medical staff tending to him for several minutes on the pitch as his teammates applauded the fans at the other end

but cowley said i think hes fine he was able to finish the game and we spoke to him on the way in to the postmatch press conference and he was full of beans hopefully hell come through

it was a tough night we played with real high intensity and well have expended a lot of energy but ultimately it was a positive performance and sometimes although your bodys aching after a game when you play well it kind of doesnt feel so bad

cowley also indicated that opening goalscorer chris willock had been brought into the starting lineup for the first time slightly quicker than anticipated

he said chris willock was on his full debut he probably wasnt ready to go and play the 70 minutes he did but we felt it was the right time to freshen up the attacking line

as to whether he and emile smith rowe will therefore be fit and ready to start saturdays game against charlton cowley said we have to see how emile recovers now we certainly hope so him and chris willock they put in a good shift

we play charlton saturday and theyre playing wednesday night nicky and i will go and watch them at sheffield wednesday they have a difficult turnaround themselves we had it ourselves the previous week cardiff to derby and that doesnt give you much time

weve got day extra recovery than charlton and we need to make sure we utilise that and start to prepare for a very important game on saturday ; realme 6 will come with a 64 mp quadcamera setup and a dual punchhole display

fears of being past it holding brits back from making career changes

seven in ten workers are stuck in the wrong jobs as the prospect of making a career change seems so challenging that they would rather put themselves through a punishing workout reveals new research from lifeskills created with barclays

todays up and coming workforce think they cant change career after 30

fears of being too old to boost their careers are also holding many people back from a happier work life almost half 48 per cent of workers think there is a cut off age to being able to make a career change

ironically this feeling is particularly profound in the younger generation with more than one in ten gen zers 13 per cent thinking they wont be able to make a career change past the age of 30

in reality however a successful career change can be made at any age looking at people over 55 that have made a change at some point in their career more than four in ten 42 per cent say they did so over the age of 45

the first of the 10 clubs will open in april at marina gate dubai and will be the brands 33rd club in the club and its 23rd in dubai

other locations set to open include silicone oasis and the meadows in dubai khalifa city in abu dhabi al zahia in sharjah ajman city centre in ajman as well as the oasis mall and bahrain city centre in bahrain

fitness first middle easts current clubs in dubai festival city and sahara centre in sharjah will also be relocated with improved concept clubs set to replace them

currently the health and fitness brand has more than 57 clubs across 49 locations in 6 countries including the uae saudi arabia bahrain jordan and kuwait the chain has announced that it is exploring franchise options in other territories as well

the brand aims to ensure that communities in the middle east have better access to fitness innovation and programmes with a club within a fiveminute commute from communities in each fitness first market

the exercise and club concepts set to energise the brand include dynamic boxing classes that provide sensory knockout cubed and wallless workout studios indoor cycling experiences that draw on data visualisation technology as well as online gaming and hot studios powered by infrared heating systems that warms the body directly rather than heating the air

the expansion will also mean that women can take advantage of more private ladiesonly offerings the new silicone oasis dubai festival city sahara centre sharjah and bahrain city centre clubs will all offer ladiesonly sections and facilities in addition to fitness firsts existing 22 ladies only gyms across the region

the fitness chain gave a glimpse into the future of fitness first middle east back in november with the opening of the palm club at nakheel mall dubai which has been a huge success

the expansion will also welcome fitness firsts good vibes app a memberexclusive lifestyle rewards programme that offers users unlimited access to discounts and offers from 500 brands across the gcc

commenting on the expansion the chief executive officer of fitness first middle east george flooks said we have listened to the fitness community and the regions evergrowing demand for fitness innovation and now we are tearing up the rulebook and taking the fitness first brand in a radical new direction with our club in club concept we plan to disrupt the disruptors

flooks added with the opening of our 10 clubs we are elated that our continued regional growth is being embraced by people across the region with one objective in mind  to provide the best fitness and lifestyle experiences possible to each and every member helping them to go further in fitness and in life ; higher levels of pa and higher energy expenditure with total pa were associated with higher scores in all domains of the sf36hrql questionnaire table 4 and supplementary table s2 accordingly individuals in the upper quartile of pf or with higher chair stand repetitions showed higher scores in all domains of the hrqlsf36 questionnaire including the aggregated physical and mental health domains table 5 and supplementary table s2 we repeated the analysis excluding those with very high values of chair test 2 sd n  237 and results did not change data not shown

our study showed that pf was positively associated with a better performance in the tmt measuring executive function and the cowat measuring language ability and executive control these results are in accordance with those reported by alosco et al in 200 adult patients of heart failure using a similar battery of cognitive and pf tests the authors suggested that the negative effect of obesity on cognitive function was likely a result of the combination of clinical factors obesity diabetes and hypertension and pf because we included bmi diabetes and hypertension as adjusting covariables our results suggest that pf influences cognitive function independently of these other factors

we did not find any association between the level of pa and cognitive function the association between pa and cognitive function is still controversial some previous reports have suggested a positive association for instance a study conducted in 2315 cognitively healthy elder participants from cfaswales study showed that pa was positively associated with cognitive function measured by the cambridge cognitive examination battery of neuropsychological tests and a larger observational study carried out in 93082 respondents 45 years old from 21 us states reported that people with selfreported cognitive decline were more frequently inactive than those without this subjective cognitive decline status moreover the study conducted by xu et al in 27651 participants 5085 years old showed a doseresponse relationship between pa and cognitive function other population studies and metaanalyses support an association between pa and cognitive function conversely kooistra et al did not find any association between pa and cognitive performance or cognitive decline in a baseline analysis of 1232 participants of the smartrm study these inconsistencies could be related to differences in populations and tools used to measure cognitive function and pa the intensity of the pa could also be a determinant factor the oshpe study found that moderate activity but not light activity was associated with hippocampal volume but not with memory and a recent systematic review concluded that moderate and vigorous leisuretime pa was associated with benefits in different cognitive domains in older adults therefore it is possible that an association between pa and cognitive function was significant only in individuals at a high pa level indeed our results show a trend towards a better scoring in tmt and cowat test in participants categorized as highlevel pa

the discordant results could also be attributed to the type of pa aerobic or resistancestrength exercises with aerobic exercises likely having a greater effect protocols for each type of exercise are different in intensity and length and produce different physical adaptations with aerobic exercise having a greater impact on vomax and energy expenditure we found that although higher pa and pf levels were both associated with better selfreported quality of life only pf was associated with cognitive function this differential effect could be attributed to a different impact of aerobic vs anaerobic exercise on cognitive function aerobic fitness has been positively correlated with better highinterference memory in older adults and aerobic exercises have been associated with better improvement in the score of neuropsychological tests in comparison with anaerobic exercise aerobic exercise in the elderly has also been associated with better performance on tasks requiring executive control in comparison with anaerobic exercises other reports also showed a specific association between aerobic exercise but not anaerobic exercise and executive control

moreover a metaanalysis published in 2003 found robust but specific benefits of aerobic fitness on cognitive function another metaanalysis including 29 randomized interventional trials involving aerobic exercise training n  2049 found a moderate but consistent improvement in attention and processing speed executive function and memory associated with aerobic exercise however it failed to find any association with working memory these studies strongly support the hypothesis that aerobic exercise but not anaerobic one has a specific impact on executive function we did not discriminate between aerobic and anaerobic exercise neither measured cardiorespiratory fitness however we found a significant association between tmt and cowat tests and pf tmt test measures the speed of information processing and the cowat test measures verbal memory attention and inhibition together they define the individual condition regarding executive function and cognitive control therefore our results strongly suggest that good pf achieved through an aerobic exercise program could be a significant predictor of executive function in the elderly the mechanisms behind these associations could be the increase in the hippocampal volume associated with aerobic fitness in this regard a randomized clinical trial conducted in 120 adults without dementia showed an increase in the volume of the left and right hippocampus in the aerobic exercise group and a decrease in the stretching control group after one year

interestingly authors showed a selective impact of aerobic exercise on the volume of the anterior hippocampus involved in spatial memory and submitted to agerelated atrophy however a cochrane systematic review showed no effect of aerobic exercise even if the intervention leads to an improvement in cardiorespiratory fitness on cognitive domains more extensive interventional studies are therefore needed to clarify the impact of aerobic exercise leading to an improved pf on cognitive function

we also found that pf was associated with a better quality of life with positive associations in all domains including the aggregated ones pf has been reported to account for up to 225 of the variability in the quality of life scoring of obese individuals with binge eating disorder and cardiorespiratory fitness has been suggested to be a good predictor of physical and mental quality of life in individuals with bipolar disorder our results reinforce the hypothesis that pf is associated with a better cognitive function and quality of life and encourage the development of pa programs addressed to increase pf in the late adulthood to prevent morbidity in the elderly although pa levels seemed not to be associated with cognitive function they were associated with a higher score in all domains of the quality of life questionnaire these results are consistent with the previously reported association between pa and quality of life in the elderly

in conclusion our results showed that pf but not pa level was associated with cognitive function specifically with those domains related to language ability attention and processing speed undoubtedly pa specifically aerobic exercises contribute to pf and thus pa could be associated with cognitive function through an improvement in pf our results highlight the importance of maintaining a good physical condition to retain cognitive function in this regard the primary aim of pa programs addressed to maintain cognitive health should be the improvement of pf and the type of exercise should be considered when designing pa programs

this study has some limitations first this is an observational crosssectional study that does not allow to infer causality second this is an elderly population with obesity and metabolic syndrome with an average low level of pa and without cognitive impairment and this could be masking a significant relationship between pa and cognitive function however this population is representative of a high cardiovascualr disease cvd risk elderly population in a mediumhigh income western country and this study has been carried out with a large sample and with a stringent adjustment for confounding factors third hrql and pa activities are selfreported thus we cannot rule out the overestimation or underestimation of those variables although we have adjusted for potential confounding factors age gender recruitment center adherence to an ermeddiet bmi civil status educational level sleep hours working status tv hours prevalence of t2dm depression hypertension and cancer our population is heterogeneous especially regarding sociodemographic parameters like civil status education level and working status thus we cannot rule out the possibility that this heterogeneity produced a moderation or exacerbation of the observed association between pf and cognitive function

finally we should bear in mind that past experiences or the accumulation of other factors not considered within this analysis may also have an impact on cognitive function in the elderly ; mumbai feb 26 ians bollywood actress and style diva kareena kapoor khan has shared her fitness secrets for fans

joans daughter michelle whos a fitness trainer and coach based in tulum mexico started joans account for her in 2018 michelle still helps to run the logistical and technical aspects of trainwithjoan but joan said she engages directly with her followers and community

fernandes who joined united in a 47 million deal in january following a year of speculation made his debut for the club just two days after completing his move

initial fears were that the portuguese playmaker might take some time to adapt to his new club and the more intense play style of the premier league  and united had planned accordingly with a tailored fitness programme to bring him up to speed

reports in the metro however are now claiming that the club has chosen to abandon this approach after their new star left his fellow players and staff members astonished by his condition

indeed such were his performances on the clubs midseason training camp in marbella that he actually ranked in the top three for all players at the club across the tests

as well as amazing with his physical condition fernandes is also said to have made a massive impression on his teammates with his sheer skill and technical ability

the united squad are said to have been left purring following his first training session in his new surroundings with the former sporting lisbon player also said to have remained behind after training for an additional 30 minutes of free kick practice with teammate fred

fernandes has certainly hit the ground running at united when it comes to match day performances also

thrust into a side that has been accused of lacking creativity and a player willing to take risks to make things happen the tricky midfielder has already assisted three goals and scored a further two in just his first four appearances for the red devils

there also appears to be the signs of a burgeoning relationship forming between both himself and midfield partner fred  who has been equally as impressive since his arrival  as well as the enigmatic anthony martial up front

with the returning scott mctominay and the stillinjured marcus rashford yet to properly play alongside their exciting new teammate things are certainly looking up for uniteds prospects over the remainder of the season ; they are already without gareth anscombe who is having knee reconstruction

wales will be hopeful dan biggar does not spark a backline injury crisis ahead of their six nations match against england after going off early for northampton on saturday

the 30yearold flyhalf wales only established playmaker in the squad hurt his knee 20 minutes into the saints 2721 defeat to saracens

wales will be praying when they assess biggar on monday they will agree with northampton boss chris boyd that the blow is not too serious

wales face a nervous wait over the fitness of flyhalf dan biggar after picking up a knee injury

the 30yearold welshman made an early exit during northamptons defeat to saracens

with gareth anscombe out for the season after knee reconstruction rhys patchell yet to play since the world cup after shoulder trouble and owen williams out of the tournament with a hamstring injury cardiff blues flyhalf jarrod evans is the only no 10 in their squad  and he has never started a six nations game

biggar who has 82 wales caps hyperextended his knee in the sarries game and boyd said i dont think it is serious he seems to be moving relatively okay

wales are already without gareth anscombe r who is undergoing knee reconstruction

i dont think hes got any major structural damage from what im led to believe so its one of those ones well wait and see

george north who suffered a headknock and then failed an hia against france last time out is back in full training and wales hope liam williams and josh navidi are also fit for twickenham ; australian fitness model stephanie sanzo stretched warmed up her muscular frame in the most recent video on her instagram page dressed in a pink sports bra and black leggings the motheroftwo started the routine by stretching into the downward dog yoga pose she started the move on her hands and knees and then pressed her hips back while dropping her torso to the floor in her caption she recommended doing 10 reps holding each pose for three seconds

next she moved on to doing sidelying thoracic spine rotations for this exercise she lay with her arms arm outstretched and her hands clasped before twisting her torso to the other side while reaching one arm up in tandem with the rotation her caption suggested doing 10 of these on each side

after she was done with that exercise she brought out a resistance band for a series of dislocations and pullaparts the first exercise required her to lift the band behind her head repeatedly for the pullaparts she had to stretch the band outwards with a lateral motion of her arms she also did face pulls with the band which as the name suggests required her to pull it towards her head then she moved on to straight arm pulldowns with the band before she whipped out a purple kettlebell for singlearm presses

in addition to the warmup routine stephanie also shared a weightlifting demonstration for her fans with exercises that targetted the shoulders and back

the clip has been viewed close to 50000 times as of this writing and more than 100 instagram users have commented on it in those comments fans thanked her for being open about her warmup routine

amazing that you show this most of bodybuilders on instagram dont show the warmups one person wrote

love this steph as usual putting out the amazing and helpful content another added hope youve had a great weekend

others used the post as an opportunity to compliment the blond beauty

warm i think you look hot the moment you walk in the gym a third commenter added

and then there were those who had questions for stephanie

hi steph do you recommend deadlifting every week or do you think its important to take a week or two for recovering and resting the nervous system an inquisitive commenter asked

in her reply stephanie said that it was perfectly fine to do deadlifts every week but that shed include a deload week every four to eight weeks if she felt burned out as muscle and strength notes in weightlifting deload weeks are when lifters normally do one of three things lessen the weight they use decrease their normal number of reps or swap out some to the exercises they regularly use in their circuits

  there was a time in my training journey where i never used to take my warm ups seriously    i think its hard to appreciate their importance  but that tends to change pretty quick after you get hurt from not warming up properly   this is what happened to me and ever since then  ive made sure my warm ups are a priority before every session   it should be noted that an effective warm up should go well beyond simply warming up the body   one of their other objectives is to improve your joint mobility and muscular stability   this will help you move better feel better perform better as well as drastically decrease your likelihood of injury   heres a thorough warm up for the upper body as an example this should only take 68 mins   warm up routine i downward dog x 10 3 sec holds ii side lying thoracic spine rotations x 10ea iii band dislocations x 20 iv band pull aparts x 20 v band face pulls x 20 vi band straight arm pulldowns x 20 vii kb bottoms up single arm press x10ea  ive also included a workout for you to try which was focused on the shoulders  back taken straight from my program build 20   1 standing barbell press 46 2 chin ups can be assisted 44 3a barbell curl  press 48 3b dumbbell sir charles lateral raise 48 4 dumbbell single arm row 410  song  leviation by the lavish

ainsley paired the top with a pair of black ripped jeans the midrise cut flattered her hourglass figure and the cutout accents in the garment showed off even more skin from the fitness star the finishing touch in the look was a pair of black laceup booties

ainsley kept the rest of her look relatively simple opting for a pair of pearl stud earrings and a silver cuff bracelet for her accessories her makeup was freshfaced consisting of a simple brush of mascara and some clear lip gloss her brunette locks were styled straight and sleek

the evening on ice was a far cry from ainsleys update earlier this week where she posed outside against a blue wall in a black laceup bikini as was previously covered by the inquisitr ; osteoarthritis has been linked to the wear and tear of living an active life yet theres little science to suggest a lifelong love of exercise will lead to sore joints

if youre of a certain age you probably know all about the aches and pains of osteoarthritis a progressive disease found most often in the hips knees hands and spine osteoarthritis is characterized by joint stiffness and pain caused by the breakdown of cartilage and bone in the joint felt largely by the over50 crowd its been linked to the wear and tear associated with living an active life yet theres little science to suggest a lifelong love of exercise will lead to sore knees and hips in fact exercise is considered a valuable part of any treatment plan designed to relieve pain and improve the function of affected joints

as important as exercise is in managing osteoarthritis theres no universal prescription guaranteed to make aching joints feel and move better so while its clear that some exercise is better than no exercise opinion varies as to whether hitting the pool gym track bike or yoga mat is the best option of course that doesnt stop friends neighbours coworkers and even physicians from sharing their view on the type of exercise they feel will make the pain go away including suggesting that you give up the activities you love in favour of those you dont

understanding that individual experiences shouldnt be mistaken for a universal truth a team of researchers reviewed 103 published studies featuring the results of 9134 study subjects on the effectiveness of different types of exercise on improving pain and function in osteoarthritic hips and knees the studies were separated into groups depending on the type of exercise used in the protocol  aerobic exercise swimming running cycling strength training body weight or weight training exercises mindbodyflexibility exercises yoga pilates and mixed exercise more than one type performed in a single workout  and evaluated on how effective they were in reducing pain and improving function and quality of life

assessing benchmarks from the start of a regular exercise routine to eight weeks later all of the exercise protocols demonstrated a positive effect on joint function and pain compared to the nonexercise controls but when comparing one type of exercise to another aerobic exercise and mindbody exercise proved the most effective at decreasing joint pain and improving joint function less effective was strength training with mixed exercise providing the least amount of positive benefit

why do some types of exercise work better than others at making knees and hips feel 10 years younger the researchers have a hunch

although the underlying mechanism remains unclear the effect of both aerobic and mindbody exercise may be attributable to the potential of these exercises to influence altered central elements such as central pain sensitization sleep disturbance and mood disorders they said

whether theres enough science to rule out any one type of exercise from the spectrum of options prescribed to reduce osteoarthritis pain is questionable but whats interesting about this review is the lack of effectiveness of mixed exercise given the limited amount of detail regarding the mixed exercise routines included in the studies its difficult to state unequivocally that workouts like hiit highintensity interval training or crossfit are ineffective at making osteoarthritic joints move and feel better combined with the fact that exercise adherence is linked to exercise enjoyment giving up your favourite mixed routine in favour of aerobic or mindbody options isnt necessary but if youre unhappy with the results of your workout adding a few more aerobic workouts or yoga classes to your routine might be worth the effort

on the plus side its clear that staying physically active improves joint health thats great news for exercise junkies who have been told to rest their aching joints or for those who have been advised to give up their favourite aerobic activity in favour of something less stressful on the joints still you need to pay attention to your body and what makes exercise tick for you even in the face of growing evidence that some types of exercise are better for your aching joints than others

if youre always sore after an aerobic workout try yoga if yoga or strength training makes your joints ache hop on a bike ideally your preferred exercise routine dulls joint pain and improves joint function which means greater range of motion and less stiffness in the morning given that all forms of exercise are osteoarthritisfriendly when compared to no exercise at all theres no shortage of options

one final caveat give your joints time to get used to a new form of exercise before discarding it as ineffective sometimes a little discomfort arrives ahead of relief so be patient that said pain is different than discomfort so dont ignore your bodys red flags the end goal is not only finding an exercise routine that helps your joints move more and hurt less but one youll stick with for more than eight weeks ; fitness model michie peachie trained her legs and glutes in the most recent video series on her instagram page dressed in a golden yellow crop top and matching leggings the brunette beauty started the workout with a series of leg curls at a cable machine for this exercise she leaned forward and braced herself against the exercise machine to maintain her balance with the strap attached to her left ankle michie bent her active leg bringing her heel closer to her glutes

in the second video she powered through a set of sumo squat deadlifts which required her to assume an extreme widelegged stance as she pulled the handle of the cable machine up with her arms then she moved on to doing cable monster walks which saw her take short steps to the side in a crouched position with the cable weight strapped beneath one foot

in the fourth and final clip michie tackled a series of straight leg cable kickbacks on an inclined exercise bench much like the first video michie attached the weight to her ankle but this time she propped herself on her elbows and one knee on the bench while lifting her active leg

in her caption michie said that her outfit was from bombshell sportswear a brand that she has worn in several of the videos on her instagram page while she didnt share any additional information about the items she wore a glance at the brands website reveals that she sported their elite seamless leggings and pullover but unfortunately for anyone who wants to copy michies workout look the top is currently sold out in that color the leggings are available however and retail for 68

the post has been liked close to 11000 times since it was uploaded and in the comments section fans showered michie with praise

oh yeah you look amazingly beautiful one person wrote before adding a star and rose emoji to their comment

you have worked hard and look beautiful a second commenter wrote

and her allyellow outfit got some attention as well

omg that set looks so good on you another commenter added

but amid all of the compliments one fan had a question about the straightleg cable kickbacks that michie included in her circuit

how do you get the ankle strap to stay on the front of your foot while doing exercise 4 they asked

michie hasnt responded to the query as of this writing

a post shared by   michie_peachie on feb 29 2020 at 1023pm pst ; morgan was alerted to a problem by his watch which prompted him to visit his gp

a superfit coventry university student was diagnosed with leukaemia  after he was alerted by his fitness watch

morgan paine went to his gp after the data told him his resting heart rate had rocketed while he was also pale and slightly breathless

the 21yearold from coseley in the black country had a blood test which detected anomalies and within hours he was in hospital and diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia reports birminghamlive

his mum samantha aged 43 told birminghamlive morgan is a very fit young man who has taken part in long distance charity cycle rides for charities and has done a number of triathlons

he checked his resting heart rate with his fitness watch and it had gone up from 44 to 66 which was very unusual and worrying

he had also been pale and a bit breathless so he went to see the doctor his red blood cells were very low and it was only because his heart was so strong that he was getting enough oxygen

the doctor asked him to have a blood test we received a call hours later saying he had to go to hospital straight away the doctor said he should have been in a coma and it was only because he was so fit that he hadnt collapsed

morgan a coventry university physical geography student was diagnosed on november 21 last year

he spent two days at new cross hospital in wolverhampton before being transferred to the queen elizabeth hospital in birmingham for another eight weeks he continues to have chemotherapy

samantha added morgans diagnosis has hit our family very hard we are a very close family we all like to keep ourselves fit and my husband jon and morgan took part in a 1400 mile cycle ride called rome to home in 2018 for charity

his sister alexandra is currently taking her alevels and it is affecting her badly she is currently unable to complete her alevels due to the affect morgans diagnosis has had on her

morgan is a very positive young man he celebrated his 21st birthday while he was in hospital despite what he is going through he is always smiling and positive and really gives the rest of the family a lift

both sam and jon are selfemployed and a gofundme fundraising page has been set up to help support the family while morgan receives his treatment which could take more than two years

morgan wants to raise awareness of the condition and to encourage people to listen to their bodies

the family also wants to raise awareness of the financial issues facing the families of students still living at home

sam and jons critical illness cover does not cover their children after the age of 18 yet morgan is still in fulltime education and they have been unable to work for lengthy spells as they support their son

view gallery

the fundraising post said we are have been and will do whatever is necessary to support morgan to get the treatment he needs to be able to fight the leukaemia

unfortunately this leaves us as two selfemployed people receiving no financial support with mounting costs from travel parking time off work clothes and other items that morgan needs as he has lost a lot of weight and has side effects from the treatment

we are also faced with the potential cost of exam fees for our daughter who is unable to do her alevels to her full potential due to the affect her brothers illness has had on her

we are a very close and proud family who find it very hard to ask for help however this is the situation we find ourselves in the target amount of money to raise is unquantifiable as we do not know what the future holds and what treatment morgan will need or for how long

anything that is donated above our additional costs and any extra help that both morgan and his sister need to finish their education will be donated to the teenage cancer trust and the queen elizabeth hospital charity

so far 3900 has been raised for the family

the owls boss made three substitutes by the start of the second half taking off kadeem harris and steven fletcher as well as club captain tom lees who he said failed to give him the sort of response he would have wanted after his mistake let in tom lawrence for derbys second goal

lees lost the ball to rams forward chris martin in the 24th minute and failed to recover his ground as lawrence bagged his second of the afternoon

the owls produced a lacklustre first half display to enter the break three goals down and despite an improved second period they never really threatened to get back into the game

lees was hooked at halftime for dominic iorfa who produced an altogether stronger display in an improved owls second half

fletcher making his first start since sustaining a knee injury in their fa cup win at brighton on january 4 was replaced at halftime by josh windass kadeem harris exited in just the 38th minute and was replaced by connor wickham

on the reasons behind his captains removal monk said his performance wasnt good enough yes he made the mistake but then afterwards he didnt respond to that which i expect

you make the changes fletchers one i spoke to him just before halftime and he was tired obviously steven isnt fully fit and obviously hes come back in a needs must situation

that was more precautionary but the other two were to try to make a change tactically to try and give us more impetus and fight back in that second half

we were the better team in that second half but it was too little too late with the first half that we had

it was a very unfortunate first goal but to compound that with really poor mistakes thats not good enough ; kuching huaweis latest fitness smartwatch huawei watch gt 2 which comes in two versions 46mm and 42mm is powered by its proprietary kirin a1 chip delivering an upgraded experience for its users

in the clip that displayed the correct form she kept her back steady and lifted the weights until they were parallel with her shoulders and not above them

in the caption she instructed viewers not to use momentum to lift the weights and to ensure that the dumbbells are facing the body as theyre raised she also encouraged fans to maintain a braced core when they attempt the exercise and to use slow controlled movements as they complete their reps

lisa stressed that the she isnt trying to shame anyone for doing lateral raises the wrong way her goal with the video was to help people maximize the potential of the exercise and prevent potential injury she said before expressing hope that they found the video useful

the clip has been viewed close to 170000 times as of this writing and more than 100 instagram users have commented on it in those comments fans shared their appreciation for her demonstration of proper lateral dumbell raise form

fab tip i have to use teeny tiny weight for this one but i know its effective one person wrote thanks for sharing lisa

i love these videos theyre super important another

and one fan confessed that they used to do the exercise the wrong way

this was me once upon a timebut i soon realized the weight was too heavy another added

but amid all of the supportive messages one commenter had criticism for lisa

im sorry but i find your dos and dont posts to be a bit exaggerated on the dont i go to the gym a lot and i never see people doing exercises the wrong way to the extreme you portray the dont they wrote bring it down a notch

lisa hasnt responded to the comment as of this writing but other commenters replied to assert that they had seen gymgoers doing the exercise incorrectly in the way that the british fitness trainer displayed

here is a lateral raise do and dont  the left shows a common mistake made and the right shows one of the correct ways to perform this exercise   remember there is nothing to be ashamed of if you perform it like the one on the left i just really want to help you get the most out of every exercise and to avoid injury remember we all start somewhere and we all have to learn no one was ever excellent to start with  i really hope this helps you    dont careful not to swing with the lower back and use momentum to get the weights up make sure youre not letting the dumbells twist and face away from you as you lift the arms as this takes tension away from the middle head of the shoulder    do keep core braced and lead with the back of the hand elbow and little finger all coming out nicely in a line that matches how the middle felt contracts being careful not to rotate the arms control it as you come back down and change direction with control  are you ready to start your health and fitness journey click the link in my bio to download the strongandsxy fitness app and enjoy 7 days for free   for my gym accessories that will change your lifting game  click the link in my bio and head over to lisafiittcom

law enforcement member working out wsaw photo

most law enforcement departments in wisconsin do not have annual programs to measure employee fitness after an officer or deputy is hired according to the wisconsin professional police association

that lines up with what 7 investigates learned from area departments including the marathon county sheriffs office wausau police department oneida county sheriffs office and others one local exception apart from marshfield was the wisconsin rapids police department whose contract includes a clause providing for an annual physical assessment and a requirement to maintain physical fitness as determined by a doctor another type of fitness program around the state include departments such as appleton police that have incentivebased annual fitness programs

stevens point assistant police chief tom zenner told newschannel 7 the department is paying close attention to the marshfield case wausau deputy chief matt barnes also noted they are actively looking at whats in the best interest of the police department with the belief that physical fitness is important

wisconsin not unlike many other states does not set statewide fitness standards for law enforcement the state department of justice through its training  standards bureau has had a fitness test for students entering and exiting their law enforcement academy program since 2016 but the law enforcement standards board  a group of 12 chiefs and sheriffs created by wisconsin law to set certifications and training across the state  leaves it up to individual departments to decide what physical fitness requirements are set for officers they hire once they complete the academy that also applies to any fitness requirements placed on officers and deputies throughout their careers

that doesnt mean wellness of all types including physical isnt encouraged and mcsos sheriff scott parks noted that the physical requirements for their bomb squad are federally regulated the wausau police department has four committees dedicated to officer wellness including one for physical fitness nearly all police chiefs or sheriffs that 7 investigates reached out to noted that wellness if not mandated was still an encouraged priority nationwide a 2016 task force led in part by the international association chiefs of police iacp designated officer safety and wellness as one of the key pillars necessary for driving healthy communitypolice relations

but in regards to establishing annual requirements for officer physical fitness wisconsin law stops short any changes that would allow the doj to set statewide fitness requirements for law enforcement would require change at a legislative level according to doj deputy communications director rebecca ballweg the lesb has discussed that in the past shelly sandry with the dojs training and standards bureau said but its never gone forward

the belief is that chiefs and sheriffs should be able to make their own decisions based on their department sandry said about fitness standards it is encouraged that every agency has a wellness program

ofc beauchamp a longtime mpd patrol officer who during his career had suffered a knee injury failed the physical fitness test by about 30 seconds during the quartermile run he was subsequently terminated prompting the wppa to enter negotiations with the mpd to reinstate him

palmer believes gramza needs to legally demonstrate that the test resulting in ofc beauchamps termination was an appropriate measure of his essential job duties and that it does not include discrimination newschannel 7 has attached both the mpd annual test standards and the mpd job requirements to this article

the absence of annual physical tests resulting in termination helps municipalities avoid liability from having to enforce standards that may affect different people differently palmer said citing people with disabilities women and older employees

we believe he applies a more lenient test for new police officer applicants who would obviously tend to be younger palmer said referring to mpds initial medical clearance for newlyhired officers experienced officers such as jared beauchamp deserve more respect for their many years of service to the community

while gramza declined to comment on this story due to the ongoing nature of the personnel negotiations with the wppa newschannel 7 found a 2019 interview with the marshfield news outlet on focus where gramza discussed the new annual fitness requirements that were built into the contract

not a lot of agencies do this but its also i think very overdue in the profession gramza told on focuss karlie hohl in 2019 we consider this part of their essential job functions in the interview he cited a consultant that had helped develop the test specifically to meet marshfields policing needs

according to palmer negotiations with gramzas attorney are not progressing well and that its likely the case will result in a lawsuit ; french fitness model anais zanotti who is famous on instagram for her incrediblyhot physique recently went online and treated her fans to a new snap

aerial arts classes are about slowly gearing your body up to pull off the spectacular moves you might see in a circus which can take weeks or even months to master weight loss is not the goal here its more of an art form than exercise that said you will start to replace fat with muscle as you become leaner stronger and fitter people who have tried gym memberships without success stick with aerial classes because they dont feel like a workout

its democratic

the form is open to people of all genders and sizes its not solely for lithe athletic people  the focus is on what your body can do its good for your mental health too the complex movements exercise your brain while developing coordination

you dont need to start strong

hoop and silks require upper body strength but you gain that while learning the moves after half a dozen classes you will be able to achieve things you thought were out of reach in your first lesson

as told to indiamae alby ; one of the most consistent expanding business models in the country is fitness gyms

while bigbox gyms are popping up all over town theres a group of doctors that think theres room for a boutique gym of their own

united medical fitness is a 4000 square foot medically integrative fitness facility in south temecula off temecula parkway that enjoyed a soft opening last week

i believe this gym was necessary for this valley for many reasons fitness director jennifer sinclair said currently the valley has two main options large corporate gyms with basic amenities or small boutique gyms that charge a rate that most people cant afford there are few inbetween options and even fewer that offer a large range of fitness and medical services under one roof our fitness center was necessary to change the game of health and fitness by offering extensive services for a price the general population can afford with some insurances even covering the cost of the monthly membership the wave of the future in health and wellness is fitness combined with medical healthcare and we wanted to be the first to bring it to the valley

she said the origins of the gym started just up the road in murrieta

united medical fitness started as a small little gym in the back of a gastroenterology practice in murrieta sinclair said it was a simple boutique type gym with the intention of assisting the practices weight loss patients as time went on and i joined the practice i saw that we had the capability to create something that no one else had a fitness center coupled with medical professionals and services

in collaboration with united medical doctors ceo dr john hong we created a multifaceted facility that catered to the general public who needed more than your average gym

sinclair said the boutique gym has services and amenities unlike any other gym  including a dietitian on staff medical weight loss iv hydration therapy body comp testing blood work and more she said theres a juice bar on the way as well

the facility is supervised by physicians sinclair said we do have doctors and other medical providers on site we can schedule consultations followups and checkups in our facility in fact we recommend that our members schedule an appointment with one of our providers to enhance their experience and make sure whatever program they choose they are safe and effective

the benefits are provided individually or through package programs members can optin or optout of any of the services she said the best part is that since we are a medical facility some of our services may be covered by insurance

united medical fitness will hold a grand opening event on thursday march 19 new members who come in now can receive a free unlimited week when they sign up

sinclair said the gym isnt limited to people who need medical supervision

this fitness facility is beneficial for all people she said whether they are simply trying to lose weight rehabbing an injury or are dealing with other medical conditions all of the staff here are highly trained and experienced everyone who walks through the door is being supervised by our kinesiologists so despite what their end goals are they are in good hands

sinclair said the gym is different in other ways as well

the atmosphere here is much different than your average big box gym she said when you walk in you are immediately greeted by our friendly staff we make sure to know your name ask how you are doing and create an atmosphere where you feel supported and valued while also offering state of the art medical services we are proud to have a communitybased atmosphere and that is what our members consistently communicate to us that they love

we hope that people who come to this gym get an experience that motivates them to create longlasting change she said we want our members to utilize our services and in turn live longer feel better emotionallyphysically as well as have better quality lives wholebody wellness is the end goal and all of our services and amenities foster that journey

askmen may get paid if you click a link in this article and buy a product or service to find out more please read our complete terms of use ; review  the centers for disease control and prevention cdc recommend that american adults engage in at least 150 minutes of moderate exercise each week this roughly translates into taking 10000 steps a day the mayo clinic however estimates that the average american only walks 3000 to 4000 steps a day far short of what is healthy my wife agreed to test letscoms fitness tracker as part of her efforts to get to that 10000step level is this the right gadget for the job read on to find out

it is a fitness gadget worn on the wrist that tracks exercise and sleep patterns monitors heart rate and provides alerts and alarms

my wife has been wearing this gadget for 3 weeks nonstop except when she showers or when it needs charging shes utilized the majority of its features and has a good appreciation of its capabilities heres what she found

the fitness tracker comes in three pieces the tracker itself and the 2 halves of the watch band the tracker is approximately 15 inches long and ¾ of an inch wide and has connectors for the wrist band on the top and the bottom

when flipped over you can see that one of the connectors is used for charging and that theres a monitor that will be against the skin

the first step in the installation process is to charge the tracker for at least 2 hours which my wife did by connecting it to our anker usb charging station when you plug it in you have to make sure that the little red light comes on otherwise it wont actually charge

the second step is to attach the watch band make sure that bottom side the one with the little button connects to the band with the holes and the top side connects to the band with the buckle

the third and final step is to download the mobile app there are a pair of qr codes in the manual one for ios and one for android for ios this takes you to the veryfitpro app which is a free download

the fitness tracker has 7 modes each with its own unique screen you can cycle through the modes by pressing the button the screen is not a touch screen so the only interaction is via the one button

the main screen shows the time like a watch it can be configured to show the date battery status bluetooth status or the steps taken today

step mode shows how many steps have been taken today how many miles have been walked how many minutes have been active including walking and how many calories have been consumed

heart rate mode measures the current beats per minute bpm

alarm mode displays your next alarm and allows you to disable it new alarms can only be set via the mobile app and yes my wifes next alarm is for 430am she gets up way too early to teach esl to international students

walk mode allows you to track the steps taken and time spent on a specific walk you use the button to tell the tracker when you stop and start your walk it will also monitor your heart rate while walking although my wife didnt test the run and bike modes she assumes they offer similar capabilities to the walk mode

the trackers interface is as simple as it gets this makes it easy to move between the modes and use them as necessary the more advanced functionality comes through the trackers interaction with the mobile app

the only downside to the tracker is that the process of monitoring the heart rate involves the use of a rather bright green strobing light during the day this is not noticeable but if youre a light sleeper as i am this can wake you up at night

letscom has created a mobile app that works with the fitness tracker by providing better visualization and longterm storage of the fitness data to use the mobile app my wife first paired it with the tracker she made sure bluetooth was enabled on her phone then she opened the app selected the device button chose bind device and then selected id115plus hr from the list of devices whenever she wants to sync the data in the tracker with the app she simply has to swipe down on the main page when her phone is near the tracker

the bottom of the mobile app has 5 buttons mainpage details device user and a giant orange plus the mainpage button shows the main page which is a fairly detailed visualization of all activities that have been completed so far today for example it lists the steps taken calories burned and time spent in an activity

if you click on the sleep tab it shows how long you slept and if you touch the number of hours then it shows your sleep patterns for the previous night

the details button depicts overviews for today this week this month and this year if you swipe to the right on any of these screens you can see previous days weeks months and years

the device button specifies how the mobile app interacts with the fitness tracker for example it can set alerts when your phone gets a call or a text or when youve been stationary too long when your phone receives a call it briefly displays the phone number or contact name on the trackers when it receives a text or a private message from apps like facebook instagram and wechat it briefly displays the text on the tracker

the user button sets a variety of information about you the user of the tracker such as the number of steps you hope to walk in a day and your preferences such as imperial vs metric units its worth noting that the third party program features allows you to send information to the apple health app on your iphone if you have one

the giant orange plus button functions like a popup menu that brings up three more menu choices the first choice is used to record runs walks hikes and rides if you dont have your fitness tracker with you the second choice is used to record a variety of different activities such as yoga badminton and mountain climbing the third choice is used to record your weight

in general my wife really likes the mobile app she finds that the main screen is helpful for getting a quick overview about how shes progressing during the day she also finds the various charts and graphs to be informative

she also discovered three problems one the sedentary alert sometimes goes off right after she finishes walking two the sleep monitor doesnt record afternoon naps as sleeping three messages from her phone are displayed too briefly and theres no way to go back and read them again in general these are fairly minor problems that dont detract much from the quality of the mobile app although it did leave her wondering if its worth paying more for a more powerful gadget like an apple watch

to recharge the battery my wife has to pull off the lower half of the band the first time she tried to pull it off she couldnt as it was so tight she asked for me to help and it still took me over 2 minutes to get it off over time however this has become easier as the band has loosened up i am concerned that if this process continues it will eventually become so loose that it wont stay on the tracker i wish that letscom has designed an alternate mechanism for attaching and detaching the band or a completely different mechanism for charging although the battery is rechargeable the manual notes that it is not replaceable

the tracker that my wife tested was black but it also comes in blue purple red green and pink

while reading the manual i came across several scary and slightly humorous statements

when considering fitness trackers including letscoms keep in mind that these devices typically are not considered to be medical devices as they are not approved by the fda they can be helpful in estimating your health but they are not guaranteed to be accurate if you have a medical or heart condition you will probably want to look at a different category of gadgets

while there may be fancier fitness trackers on the market letscoms fitness tracker is perfect for healthconscious people who are either trying out their first tracker or who dont want to pay premium prices it does everything that a fitness tracker needs to do and more and its mobile app provides lots of extra functionality if you are in the market for a tracker my wife recommends that you take a look at this one and so do i ; review  i have lost count of how many portable gyms and gymlike devices i have purchased over the years that have promised to fit into my busy schedule and to provide a relatively quick full body workout that will keep me fit one way or another they have fallen short of the goal either because they did not live up to their promise or they were not as portable or as easy to use as expected i have all but given up on these types of devices and i use my treadmill as much as i can but now i see a new device that has gained my interest enough for me to try one more time lets see if the oyo fitness gym can earn any redemption for its counterparts or if it ends up in the historic pile in the corner of my storage room

the oyo fitness gym le is a total body gym that weighs 2 lbs but produces up to 25 lbs of resistance for training and exercise it can be folded to fit in your edc bag or large pocket so that you can use it on the go wherever and whenever you choose to

1 x oyo personal gym le

1 x door attachment

3 x flexpacks

2 x leg attachments

1 x product guide

when you open the oyo fitness box the inside cover reveals a quick start guide describing how to attach the flexpacks

the picture below shows the oyo fitness gym with 2 flexpacks attached the first flexpack must be a 10lb resistance pack and a total of 3 flexpacks come with the gym oyo fitness does not sell additional flexpacks separately you can also see that in the second picture below the gym can be collapsed into a very portable package

in the closeup picture below of the flexpack on one side there is the center spindle with internal gears that lines up with the other flexpacks which allow them to connect to each other the red arrow shows the marking for the correct orientation to add each flexpack to the other there are 3 holes that accept the legs from other flexpacks as a part of the securing mechanism on the flipside of the flexpack there is the gear spindle with external that protrudes and connects to another flexpack and three notched legs that also connect and secure the flexpacks to each other

the following picture shows the 2 included straps that connect to each side of the oyo gym and allow the gym to be strapped to your legs or arms for different types of exercises

the other included strap allows you to attach to a door or pole or other objects for various exercises

when i opened the oyo fitness gym box i was pleasantly surprised at the quality of each component and the compact size the instructions are clear and you can get started right away adding and removing the flexpacks to adjust the resistance is quite easy and the basic exercises can all be performed with just the oyo and the flexpacks oyo includes straps that allow you to attach the gym to a door or any such structure to accomplish pulley type exercises that you would normally do with a larger gym system at first i was skeptical about whether or not this compact device could actually provide enough resistance to even make most folks break a sweat but i soon found out that it is quite capable of doing so and very versatile it gives me a full workout and can be used by the enthusiast the occasional visitor or the fitness fanatic

the following are some of the exercises performed by my model

one issue i did experience is that the rotation of the spindle with the gears in the center of the flexpack changed and i could not attach it to any other flexpack once i recognized what had happened i used an adjustable wrench to turn it back to the correct orientation it did take some effort to do so

with each day that goes by life gets even busier and dedicating time to workout without interruptions or within my hectic schedule often leads to a great plan that becomes very shortlived as i get older using heavy weights or even many of the machines and equipment that a conventional gym offers is not as desirable or as necessary as it used to be as when i was much younger while the oyo fitness gyum does not replace a planet fitness or that type of gym my experience with it has been great for my goals i am able to keep my muscles working do some resistance and cardio via repetitions training and there is enough builtin versatility to get a complete fitness workout it is not a bodybuilding gym but it fulfills its purpose of allowing me to workout whenever and wherever my schedule allows and it is compact enough to go with me without becoming a burden this is another type of device that is individually subjective and while it may not be a fit for all it does a great job for me and enough so that they get two thumbs up looking forward to the next version with the ability to add even more resistance ; technavio has been monitoring the fitness app market 20202024 and it is poised to grow by usd 168 billion during 20202024 progressing at a cagr of 12 during the forecast period the report offers an uptodate analysis regarding the current market scenario latest trends and drivers and the overall market environment

in the gorgeous new selfie the bombshell stood in front of a mirror in what appeared to be her home she held her cell phone in one hand to snap the photo and rested the other hand near her ear the brunette beauty left little to the imagination in a revealing white swimsuit that had a triangle top that showed off a ton of cleavage the bottoms were just as hot and featured flosslike sides that hit at her hip bones while her toned and tanned legs were also visible in the image

cela looked pictureperfect rocking a beautiful application of makeup that included eyeliner mascara blush highlighter and red lipstick the albianborn beauty kept her long dark tresses out of her face and wore them styled down and straight in the caption of the image cela thanked her fans for all of their love and support telling them that she has been incredibly focused on her training and eating

2 days to go till the launch of the womensbest x krissy cela series  and i am so excited thank you so much familia youve been so supportive  i appreciate you immensely also since being back home from working abroad ive been so determined and focused with my training and eating i started the expert guide on the toneandsculptapp and its killing me oh my god why did i do this to myself feels so good just investing in me and my health 

a post shared by krissy cela  workout with me krissycela on feb 28 2020 at 917am pst

even though the update has only been live on her page for a few short hours its earned the beauty a ton of attention from her nearly 2 million fans with over 77000 likes in addition to upwards of 600 comments many followers took to the shot to let cela know she looks gorgeous while countless others raved over her figure

i wanna look like you so bad one follower raved in addition to a few flame emoji

looking fab whats that plant behind you called x another fan asked with a few heart emoji tied to the end of their comment

wow oh wow body goals what a queen a third instagrammer raved

last week the inquisitr shared that the fitness superstar traveled to los angeles where she enjoyed a little work as well as a little relaxation one of the shots that was shared for fans showed the brunette beauty posing in front of the wellknown hollywood sign with her arms in the air and a smile on her face yet again her gorgeous figure on display in a blue sports bra and a pair of insanely tight gray leggings that fit her like a glove ; fitness model savannah prez gave her fans yet another look at the gains she works hard for at the gym in her latest instagram post the belgian beauty rocked a pair of lilac leggings and paired the fitted workout pants with a black tank top and white sneakers she wore her goldstreaked brown hair loose and it cascaded well past her shoulders the camera was positioned behind her a fact that likely drew lots of attention to the curves of her muscular lower body she looked over her shoulder and sent a bright smile to the viewers

but her lengthy caption indicated that the post wasnt just meant to be a showcase of her enviable fit figure in it she addressed some of the concerns some of her followers have about their progress towards their fitness goals while she said she couldnt really diagnose any individuals issues over instagram she went on to state that fitness setbacks are normally caused by these common errors nutrition lack of sleep and poor prioritization

the photo has been liked close to 10000 times as of this writing and more than 100 instagram users have commented on it so far in the comments section several fans agreed with savannahs caption and chimed in with their own thoughts about fitness mistakes

not always about the work in the gym but the recovery one person wrote

but there was one fan who disagreed with savannah and claimed that genetics and not hard work was the most important factor when trying to build areas of the body like the glutes

ive known girls who had a body like yours never been to the gym and lived on vending machines they wrote booty is all genetics squat will only tone what you already have you cannot build what doesnt exist

but savannah countered their assumption in her reply to the comment

genetics do play a role yes but pls dont tell me if you have no natural curves you can not build glutes she wrote i worked so hard to get my physique to this point and ive seen many crazy transformations from girls coming from nothing to being able to build strong glutes

someone reached out to me today asking me how it comes she isnt making the results she actually wanted to make now i told her this is a little difficult to tell what exactly shes doing wrong as it can be many different reasons  in general these are what i consider very common mistakes   nutrition youve probably heard it many times but fueling your body with the right nutrients is just a basis to getting results aside from your personal goal whether thats build or maintaining muscle or simply lose weight maintaining a healthy nutritious mealplan  lifestyle will enhance your results number one priority should be hitting your daily protein intake for me a good guideline is to eat somewhere between 1822g  kg bodyweight per day   not enough sleep  rest one of the most overlooked factors in fitness if you ask me quality over quantity so thats exactly why ive never been training more than 5 days a week it costs your body lots of energy to get through your sessions but it costs as much energy to recover if you dont allow your body enough rest youll simply stay in a constant zone of muscle breakdown and in addition to this it has a huge impact on your hormones aswell   not prioritising your goal okay your goal is to build glutes fine make this a priority in your program start the week off with a heavy glutes session dont skip or postpone the most important workouts even if you hate training them hit it right away when you feel most energized you can only train 3 times a week prioritise two of them as a glutes focused training remember you cant focus everything at the same time but what ive learned throughout the years is that if you want to develop a certain muscle you have to train them very frequently in the best case between 24 times a week  want me to help you reach your goals check my stories for a full expanation on my guides

industry keyword health fitness  nutrition mobilewireless technology software ; clearview  the latest and most troubling entrant into the facial recognition tech sweepstakes  says its product is just for law enforcement and law enforcement has seemingly welcomed the webscraped facial recognition database with open arms clearviews marketing documents claim the company works with over 900 law enforcement agencies in the united states and elsewhere in the world

clearviews app puts the agencies a few clicks away from over three billion images scraped from sites such as facebook twitter and linkedin those being scraped arent happy about it but theres little they can do but engage in some ceaseanddesist shouting

but clearviews claim that its only making this available to law enforcement agencies is false new documents obtained by buzzfeed show the company is selling its product to a number of other entities both public and private

the internal documents which were uncovered by a source who declined to be named for fear of retribution from the company or the government agencies named in them detail just how far clearview has been able to distribute its technology providing it to people everywhere from college security departments to attorneys general offices and in countries from australia to saudi arabia

thats the public sector buyin heres the private sectors investment

more than 200 companies have clearview accounts according to the documents including major stores like kohls and walmart and banks like wells fargo and bank of america while some of these entities have formal contracts with clearview the majority  as with public sector entities  appear to have only used the facial recognition software on free trials

this list also includes a number of entertainment venues casinos fitness centers and oddly enough the nba

so its not just for cops that might explain the companys handsoff attitude towards the entities it has publicly acknowledged it works with cops are encouraged to testdrive the software by searching friends and family members nothing like encouraging misuse right off the bat to dissuade law enforcement officers from using this tool for personal evil

as buzzfeed notes most of these appear to be limited trials of clearviews software but a few private entities are apparently paying for the privilege of running security camera footage against clearviews scrapedtogether database

company logs reviewed by buzzfeed news include walmart nearly 300 searches best buy more than 200 searches grocer albertsons more than 40 searches and rite aid about 35 searches kohls which has run more than 2000 searches across 11 different accounts and macys a paying customer that has completed more than 6000 are among the private companies with the most searches

meanwhile us agencies are enthusiastically participating in the exploitation of this crowdsourced so to speak database buzzfeed notes the cbp has already registered 280 accounts and run almost 7500 searches the secret service isnt far behind having run 5600 searches other federal customers include the dea atf and fbi

clearview has also stated its plan for international expansion begins and ends with canada this has already been exposed as untrue but information in these documents shows how aggressively clearview is pursuing customers around the world

it shows that clearview ai has expanded to at least 26 countries outside the us engaging national law enforcement agencies government bodies and police forces in australia belgium brazil canada denmark finland france ireland india italy latvia lithuania malta the netherlands norway portugal serbia slovenia spain sweden switzerland and the united kingdom

and while clearviews ceo has promised not to sell to adverse countries like north korea china and iran this is the only line it appears to have drawn the documents show clearview has offered its software to agencies in saudi arabia and the united arab emirates  both notorious violators of human rights

clearview clearly cant be trusted it has spent its limited time in the public eye lying about what it does and who it does it with hopefully the endless negative press will deter its growth unfortunately theres an undeniable market for unregulated facial recognition tech and clearviews promise of billions of photos to match faces against beats everything else offered by anyone else as long as the market exists clearview will fill it ; jose mourinho says there is no chance tottenham will take risks with harry kanes fitness after the england captain began working outdoors this week

the spurs manager said kane is ahead of the schedule in his recovery from surgery on a torn hamstring tendon and suggested he could be available for the final five matches of the campaign from midapril

kane has a history of returning from injury quickly and he recovered from ankle ligament damage to start last seasons champions league final having not featured for the previous six weeks

he also returned sooner expected in april 2018 ahead of the world cup and mourinho has acknowledged that is he not a player who is willing to accept protocols

asked if the club needs to realistic about kanes latest recovery mourinho said that is what we are going to be

tottenham doesnt end in may there is going to be tottenham for many many years so we would never risk harry in a difficult situation no chance he is going to be back when he is ready to be back

kane was quiet in the defeat to liverpool in the champions league final but mourinho refused to blame the 26yearold or his predecessor mauricio pochettino for his involvement

i would play only with one leg if i was a player and i was playing in a champions league final said the portuguese who won the competition with porto and inter milan

with crutches how can you stop a player playing in a champions league final every player breaks protocols to play a champions league final or a cup final there are some matches where protocols mean nothing nothing

so if that was the case i think it isnt the case to blame harry or medical departments that is just the nature of the way football is

in the absence of kane and heungmin son who is sidelined with a fractured arm spurs have relied on lucas moura and steven bergwijn as auxiliary attackers and mourinho believes the pair will benefit from the change of role in the longterm

for lucas for bergwijn for these wingers to be playing the way that they are playing and are probably going to play until the end of the season is going to make them better players when they come to the inside he added

they are players that normally play in the corridor in this moment they are learning how to play inside so i believe they are going to be better wingers in the future because then they can mix their game in the corridor and their game when they come to the central areas so it is an accumulation of experience

it would be easier for us to have kane son and moussa sissoko plus lucas erik lamela and bergwijn but i think in the end we have to see the positive side

this is what i call tactical culture a football player is not just about technical quality or the physical condition it has a lot to do with tactical culture our wingers are going to be better wingers when they go back to their normal position ; championship leeds united kalvin phillips ruled as a doubt for hull city clash by uways nisar posted on february 28 2020

leeds united will be waiting with anticipation after kalvin phillips was ruled as a doubt for the clash against hull city

marcelo bielsa revealed in his postmatch press conference following the win over middlesbrough that the yorkshireborn player is touch and go ahead of the game against the tigers he also revealed that january signing jeankevin augustin is definitely out of the fixture as he looks to recover from a minor hamstring injury via leeds live

it could prove to be a tricky game as kalvin phillips has shown how much he improves the whites midfield when he is starting after the club were swept aside by nottingham forest phillips returned to the team for the game against brentford and his performance compared to ben whites against sabri lamouchis side showed why he is so highlyrated

in the game at the city ground white proved to be anonymous despite playing in the centre of the pitch as he played the sixthmost passes for his side via whoscored a central midfielder needs to be more involved in the game and phillips showed that against the bees as he played the most passes for bielsas side

the leeds academy graduate also played the most accurate long balls and the thirdmost crosses as he helped his side in attack meanwhile the brighton and hove albion loanee was less than impressive when it came to the attacking side of the game as he played no crosses and just one long ball during the 20 loss

as you can see the 24yearold is a massive player for the outfit as seen by his ability to help the attack despite playing in a defensive midfield role white is a good defender however as displayed at the city ground he proves incredibly limited in helping in the final third

if the 135mrated as per transfermarkt phillips is missing from the starting xi the fixture could prove to be a tricky one for the elland road team who will be looking to continue their threegame winning streak

leeds fans do you think the whites will struggle without phillips let us know your thoughts below

whats a whoop you ask i had the same question dear reader when i saw these fitness bands speckling the wrists of runners and lifestyle editors that i follow and respect on instagram i needed to know what set these lil guys apart from all the other devices that remind us sentient potatoes to move and breathe every so often so i decided to find out by wearing one for 30 days

it will not count your steps or clap when you stand up from your desk instead this wristband is a quiet observer that sleeps with you works out with you and watches how you react to lifes stressful moments tbh its astrological sign is probably scorpio or pisces whoop takes time to learn about your body workouts and daily habits so it can properly give you a grade based on your strain score sleep performance and recovery performance

at the end of the day whoop also awards you with a day strain score which combines all activities over a 24hour period

did you know that youre supposed to get really deep sleep like 35 rem cycles each night in order to recover from your workouts and get stronger lol i dont do this i stay up bingewatching episodes of hot ones and then wake up at the crack of dawn to squeeze in a workout before heading to the office by the end of the week my body feels exhausted my mind feels crispy and im ready to sleep through the entire weekend

whoops emphasis on sleep reminds you to value your time in bed as if you already didnt every morning the app prompts you with a survey to ask about the details surrounding your sleep did you have two or more caffeinated beverages within four hours of bedtime did you have two or more alcoholic drinks within two hours of bedtime did you share your bed the answers you provide and your heart rate data yield your daily sleep performance number which tells you how well you slept

on days when whoop wasnt happy with my pitiful sleep performance it would tell me to nap and id reply girl when if you cant sneak in a nap at your desk you can open the apps sleep coach which tells you when you should go to bed if you want to be your best self the next day

whoop also keeps track of how well your body gets back on track from all the bs you handled like a boss the previous day in the morning the app will ask you a few questions i promise theyre quick and dont feel like homework like how are your energy levels how sore do you feel do you feel stressed sick or injured it combines your answers with data surrounding your heart rate variability hrv your resting heart rate rhr and your sleep score these metrics are calibrated to your baseline which means your recovery is personalized each day whoops website says

i often found that my recovery scores were spot on with how i was feeling irl for example one week during my trial period i knew that i was running my body down by exercising too hard every morning and working late every night this harmful cycle was reflected by my sad pathetic yellow and red recovery scores i took the hint and skipped the gym so i could sleep in and feel alive again yes it worked

by now youre probably wondering how much money you have to drop on this thing the good news is that the device is free but you have to agree to a sixmonth subscription that costs 30month  a 180 commitment

sadly whoop doesnt work with other fitness apps like strava nike run club or myfitnesspal so you wont be able to use the two together but a marketing manager at whoop disclosed that they want to make this happen in the near future in the meantime you can now create teams with other whoop users

you can record and download videos featuring your whoop data to post on any social platform like mine at the bottom of the page that way your enemies will finally understand just how powerful you are

for selfish reasons i like to have something to tap on when i need to exit an uncomfortable conversation quickly id also appreciate some visible heart rate data so i can see if my heart is about to explode during a run

whoops fiveday battery life doesnt live up to its promise but it does last longer than the charge on my apple watch i had to charge my battery every three to four days

if you want to get the best use out of your whoop you have to zhuzh your data pretty frequently one time whoop thought i was working out when i was simply washing dishes  this strap is trying to be perfect but it still needs a little bit of guidance meaning that you sometimes have to edit the duration of your workouts and sleep to match up with reality

after putting in some work for 30 days youll receive a weekly performance assessment that analyzes all your data and gives you some pointers on how to be kinder to yourself the next week data nerds rejoice

while i wasnt always able to make my whoop proud in the gym it did inspire me to tweak my bedtime behaviors to improve the quality of my zzzs i worked in bed less drank fewer glasses of wine after 8 pm and told my regular bed mate to get a whoop so he could understand why i needed eight hours and 34 minutes of deep beauty sleep before we could cuddle in the morning given that my recovery score almost always felt accurate i will definitely continue to wear the tracker over the next few months while i train for a halfmarathon and use the data to guide my runs

oh and whoop can i please have a sex score i am competitive in all aspects of life and id love to know when i outperform my partner in bed ; qimmah russo earned the attention of her 14 million instagram followers with her most recent post in which she showed off her chiseled physique in a skintight workout set on friday february 28 the fitness model and trainer took to the popular social media platform to share a series of snapshots that showed her striking different poses giving her fans different angles of her muscular body

the second saw the california native with her left side to the camera as russo lunged placing her left leg in front while stretching the opposite leg back both of her arms were up above her head the third shot was similar to the first though this time her arms touched the side of her clothes as she smiled toward the left

in the fourth and last photo russo also struck a similar pose this time she tilted her back back slightly and looked straight on at the camera with fierce eyes and lips parted

the series was an immediate hit with her fans in under an hour of going live the photos have attracted more than 5400 likes and upwards of 65 comments promising that many more interactions will pour in throughout the day

instagram users used the occasion to rave about russos beauty showering her with compliments and emoji in the comments section

love this color on you one user noted adding a hearteyes emoji at the end of the comment

you really are pretty af said another one topping off the message with a few emojis including a hearteyes face and a fire ; josé mourinho has revealed that harry kane is ahead of schedule in his recovery from a hamstring injury and could play in tottenham hotspurs final five games of the season

the tottenham head coach had initially suggested that the england striker would only be available for one or two games after he was injured against southampton on new years day

mourinho is hoping that kane and son heungmin will help tottenham in what he calls an open fight for a champions league place with several clubs including wolverhampton wanderers their opponents tomorrow

son will return from south korea this weekend after an operation on his broken arm and could be allowed to play in a lightweight cast but must first clear the government coronavirus protocol ; the kimpton surfcomber is a boutique beachfront hotel from the ihg family of hotels with great guest perks like free daily happy hour wellness classes and activities meant to encourage social mingling there are 186 affordablypriced rooms ranging from standard cityfacing rooms to deluxe oceanfront suites with separate living rooms and balconies standard rooms start as low as 150 i spent the night in a standard room with a balcony and loved the views and vintageinspired decor but found the accommodations to be noisy this hotel is best for groups of friends and families rather than couples seeking a luxurious romantic getaway read all business insider hotel reviews here

ever reminisce about that funky beach house you rented with friends that one great summer staying at kimpton surfcomber hotel is kind of like that

the 186room beachfront hotel from ihg is more laidback than many higherend south beach hotels while still offering full resort amenities and all the great perks kimpton hotels are known for like daily happy hour fitness classes bike rentals and other social gatherings

the decor is bright bold and eclectic with beachy rooms spread between two buildings that lead out to a central courtyard and pool all at budgetfriendly rates

its the kind of place groups of friends come for a girls getaway bachelor or bachelorette gathering or couples weekend i spotted a few families during my onenight stay but the crowd felt predominantly under 40

as such the vibe is a bit like a relaxed house party though its never overly raucous this is somewhere to stay when you want to feel the buzz of south beach but without the inyourface pulse of the club scene or inflated prices of luxury fivestar hotels down the street

i spent the night in an oceanfront king premier room with balcony comped for review purposes but starts around 230 per night in low season and rises to 350 at busier times the cheapest standard king deluxe room faces the city or interior and starts at 150 in low summer season or about 200 in peak season

however you should know its not the quietest hotel even if you stay away from collins avenue housed in is a historic art deco gem the buildings age gives way to noise bleed that i observed often even in a midtier room

so if youre looking for a quiet intimate retreat this is not the best fit but for kimpton fans and those wanting a fun lively and affordable stay its a solid south beach option

located on vibrant collins avenue the demure kimpton surfcomber is flanked by south beach behemoths like the sls the ritz carlton and the delano yet the hotel still made a striking first impression with preserved art deco exteriors covered in parts in rich green ivy

inside the spacious lobby the seating was cleverly designed with statement green walls and curated furnishings with bold fabrics and textiles vintage decor books and antiques served as unique accents and the open space flowed easily to the adjacent social club restaurant

foto there was no line to checkin at noon on a thursday source emily hochbergbusiness insider

i arrived on a thursday around lunchtime and there was no line ahead of me to checkin the process was quick and easy and the agent checking me in informed me of the many fun perks kimpton hotels offer here that included a free happy hour daily fitness classes and social gatherings around the pool as well as bike rentals of course its not truly free many of those perks are part of the hotels daily 34 plus tax resort fee

foto source business insider foto my room was lightfilled and spacious with more than enough room for two people source emily hochbergbusiness insider

i was booked in an oceanfront king premier room with balcony comped for review purposes but starts around 230 per night in low season and rises to 350 at busier times its quite affordable for 480 square feet plus an extra 100 square feet of outdoor balcony space its the toptier standard room before suites which include separate living room areas

i found the room to be beachy and fun with bold headboard and carpeting statement chairs and wellsized for two people there was a very large closet upon entry that could be closed by a curtain and had a robe hanging as well as a yoga mat for inroom use a staple of staying at a kimpton property

foto my desk chair and carpeting added personality to the room and kept it from feeling standard source emily hochbergbusiness insider

beachy details accented the room like the lamp fashioned out of driftwood on the desk colorful chairs and slat blinds that reminded me of beach houses ive stayed at in the past

some details showed wear and age like a metal chain on the door light staining on a lampshade and worn areas of carpeting but none of these matters were major detractors overall the room was clean and comfortable

a long midcentury modern wardrobe added vintage appeal and was topped with an honor bar of snacks sunscreen and drinks which is kimptons version of a minibar a flatscreen tv was mounted above and while it has some smart capabilities it did not offer app streaming from netflix and many channels were fuzzy and out of focus

foto the bathroom has nice amenities but is very small even for a toptier standard room source emily hochbergbusiness insider

the bathroom was very small and it is not possible for two people to use the space at once

the walkin tiled shower was stylish but lacking a full glass door only a partition it was stocked with atelier bloem products made exclusively for kimpton by malingoetz and i loved the citrusscented soap and body lotion made from fig theyre all supplied in large refillable ecofriendly bottles and if you want to take it home you can purchase from the front desk for 36 each

i also appreciated a note in the bathroom that offered to supply or lend any forgotten items ranging from deodorant or razors to static spray and phone chargers

foto my balcony offered a prime perch over all the hotel action at the pool source emily hochbergbusiness insider

my favorite part of the room was the pretty balcony overlooking the pool scene with the ocean in the distance it was far more spacious than the average terrace with two sunbeds and bright yellow rocking chairs its a great option if the pool area gets too crowded or you want to retreat to the room but not give up the sun entirely

foto the balcony is very nice and large but not totally private source emily hochbergbusiness insider

the only odd part was the lack of privacy windows from the room next door looked directly onto my balcony and its easy to make eye contact if someone is passing by and the shades arent closed its something to keep in mind if youre opting for a balcony as an intimate romantic extra

in all i thought the room was quirky wellsized and comfortable but noisy i was on the second floor at the end of the hall so i did not hear noise from next door but there was a lot of noise from outside during the day and the sounds of doors slamming were especially loud and woke me up early

i also observed heavy footsteps from above and the constant creaking of the nearby stairwell door opening and closing next to my room i can only imagine that had i been surrounded by more rooms on each side or faced collins it would be even noisier

should i return to this hotel i would book a top thirdfloor room even if it meant sacrificing the balcony light sleepers should come prepared with earplugs or consider another option if thats a dealbreaker however for most the noise is intermittent enough and quiet late at night

as mentioned kimpton surfcomber charges a 34 plus tax resort fee that grants access to the hotels daylife slate of fitness classes social activities lawn games and familyfriendly options

it also provides the popular daily social hour in the lobby with free wine and snacks which attracted many guests during my stay

additionally the fee includes two beach lounge chairs and towels per room plus pool towels and sunscreen boogie boards and a kids area on the beach business services such as printing and faxing free morning coffee and tea newspapers wifi and local and domestic longdistance calls

the pool deck is lined with sunbeds and there are additional chairs off to the side of the lawn area if the pool fills up its a nice touch that the hotel offers fun floaties and pool toys for guests use and the inflatable unicorn seemed to be in constant use

foto for a more indulgent pool experience cabanas are available to rent source emily hochbergbusiness insider

cabanas are also available to rent should you want a private shaded area dedicated chairs and vip waiter service it comes with a minifridge flatscreen tv glass of champagne and fruit platter prices vary depending on the cabana choice and availability

theres also a spa cabana where the hotel provides spa services or they can be arranged in the comfort of your room its a cozy spot and can even be offered openair at night for a twilight massage but prices start at 150 and rise from there which seemed a bit expensive for such a diminutive spa

the gym was closed for renovation during my stay but guests were offered access at the nearby loews hotel exhale gym which is a topoftheline facility

the hotel directly faces the beach and a lush walking path which you can cross to access the hotels dedicated stretch of sand beach chairs and towels are provided as part of the daily resort fee and umbrella rentals and activities like waverunners banana boat kayak paddle boards and parasailing are available at an added cost

kimpton surfcomber hotel is a toprated property in miami ranking 29 of 221 hotels in miami beach with a rating of 45 out of 5 on trip advisor

past guests rave about the friendly staff daylife fitness offerings the walkable beachfront location and the fun pool scene writes one review the property was very clean from the pool restrooms and all the grounds beautiful pool with both sun and shade an area with grass and games and a great outdoor bar for both lunch and drinks easy walk to the beach for chairs all the staff were friendly and helpful and went out of their way to make sure our trip was enjoyable great activities happy hours and bike riding

complaints tend to relate to noise and outdated rooms similar to my experience one review says whilst the location of the hotel is good this fell far short of expectations and provided poor value for money the resort areas for which one pays a fee on both the beach and the around the pool were claustrophobic on the beach 22 allowed rental of an antiquated small umbrella  the internet did not work on the beach and only by the pool if close to the main hotel  the rooms are tired with waferthin walls and very noisy air conditioning units and was noisy outside

who stays here budgetminded travelers looking for a fun eclectic and beachy scene the party vibe is palpable and seems to attract groups of friends bachelor or bachelorette parties and some families with older kids who appreciate all the perks and activities

we like the relaxed atmosphere and bright decor which add personality and whimsy to this boutique hotel

we love dont miss this feature all the signature kimpton amenities the resort fee is standard in miami and here it actually offers a lot of value take advantage of fitness and wellness offerings or the opportunity to mingle over free drinks and happy hour deals

we think you should know as noted this hotel can be quite noisy its not a quiet peaceful retreat

wed do this differently next time id book a top floor room to help mitigate noise but i would stay at the end of the hall again as i think its best to share as few walls as possible if you seek a quiet stay

south africa does not need a fitness regulator gym giant virgin active south africa says and consumers shouldnt have to pay for further unneeded government regulation

the company which operates 136 gyms and says it has 800000 members in south africa published the broad strokes of its objection to new legislation that is currently in draft form

the national sport and recreation amendment bill proposes giving the minister of sport more direct control of sporting codes seeks to create new sporting bodies including one to regulate combat sport  and would create a fitness industry regulatory authority

that body would have dominion over anyone who helps others get and stay fit in exchange for money and the power to classify and close down anything resembling a gym

why exactly gyms would be closed down is not clear from the draft legislation but the implication is that the regulator would be concerned primarily with safety

such a body would be unprecedented internationally virgin active says and is unnecessary

there already exist numerous other laws which comprehensively govern the industry and protect the consumer virgin active said in a statement on its submission about the draft law

industry specific regulation provides no additional value to the consumer or the industry but will instead add more cost for government the industry the individuals that operate within the industry and ultimately the consumer

the company argues that smaller operators in particular will suffer from an administrative burden under the proposal it also says government should be encouraging investment in the fitness field to counter a rise in lifestyle diseases such as obesity and diabetes

it wants selfregulation instead combined with proper enforcement by existing state agencies of legislation already in place

virgin active did not say whether it had commented on the proposal that the fitness regulator create a disputeresolution mechanisms which is anticipated to deal with complaints that difficulties cancelling gym contracts ; morgan paine aged 21 went to see his gp after checking his heart rate on his fitness watch and was diagnosed with the illness after being rushed to hospital

a superfit student was diagnosed with leukaemia  after he was alerted by his fitness watch

morgan paine went to his gp after the data told him his resting heart rate had rocketed while he was also pale and slightly breathless

the 21yearold from coseley had a blood test which detected anomalies and within hours he was in hospital and diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukemia

his mum samantha aged 43 told birminghamlive morgan is a very fit young man who has taken part in long distance charity cycle rides for charities and has done a number of triathlons

he checked his resting heart rate with his fitness watch and it had gone up from 44 to 66 which was very unusual and worrying

he had also been pale and a bit breathless so he went to see the doctor his red blood cells were very low and it was only because his heart was so strong that he was getting enough oxygen

the doctor asked him to have a blood test we received a call hours later saying he had to go to hospital straight away the doctor said he should have been in a coma and it was only because he was so fit that he hadnt collapsed

morgan a coventry university physical geography student was diagnosed on november 21 last year

he spent two days at new cross hospital in wolverhampton before being transferred to the queen elizabeth hospital in birmingham for another eight weeks he continues to have chemotherapy

samantha added morgans diagnosis has hit our family very hard we are a very close family we all like to keep ourselves fit and my husband jon and morgan took part in a 1400 mile cycle ride called rome to home in 2018 for charity

his sister alexandra is currently taking her alevels and it is affecting her badly she is currently unable to complete her alevels due to the affect morgans diagnosis has had on her

morgan is a very positive young man he celebrated his 21st birthday while he was in hospital despite what he is going through he is always smiling and positive and really gives the rest of the family a lift

both sam and jon are selfemployed and a gofundme fundraising page has been set up to help support the family while morgan receives his treatment which could take more than two years

morgan wants to raise awareness of the condition and to encourage people to listen to their bodies

the family also wants to raise awareness of the financial issues facing the familes of students still living at home

sam and jons critical illness cover does not cover their children after the age of 18 yet morgan is still in fulltime education and they have been unable to work for lengthy spells as they support their son

morgan paine is currently receiving treatment for leukemia view gallery

the fundraising post said we are have been and will do whatever is necessary to support morgan to get the treatment he needs to be able to fight the leukemia

unfortunately this leaves us as two selfemployed people receiving no financial support with mounting costs from travel parking time off work clothes and other items that morgan needs as he has lost a lot of weight and has side effects from the treatment

we are also faced with the potential cost of exam fees for our daughter who is unable to do her alevels to her full potential due to the affect her brothers illness has had on her

we are a very close and proud family who find it very hard to ask for help however this is the situation we find ourselves in the target amount of money to raise is unquantifiable as we do not know what the future holds and what treatment morgan will need or for how long

anything that is donated above our additional costs and any extra help that both morgan and his sister need to finish their education will be donated to the teenage cancer trust and the queen elizabeth hospital charity

so far 3900 has been raised for the family

researchers assessed fitness cognitive function and brain structural changes in 21 women with relapsingremitting multiple sclerosis ms

patients who were classified as being highly fit performed much better on cognitive function tests than lessfit patients mri scans also showed that higher levels of fitness were associated with greater volume of gray matter which is linked to vital brain processing skills and less damage in parts of the brain where msrelated deterioration occurs

we found that aerobic fitness has a protective effect on parts of the brain that are most affected by multiple sclerosis study lead author ruchika shaurya prakash an assistant professor of psychology at ohio state university said in a news release as a result these fitter patients actually show better performance on tasks that measure processing speed

the researchers also found that fitter ms patients showed less deterioration of brain white matter which are fibers that connect gray matter areas

the study findings were released online in advance of publication in an upcoming print issue of the journal brain research

previous research has shown that exercise promotes production of proteins called nerve growth factors which play an important role in the growth and maintenance of neurons in the brain

our hypothesis is that aerobic exercise enhances these nerve growth factors in ms patients which increases the volume of the gray matter and increases the integrity of the white matter as a result there is an improvement in cognitive function prakash said

for a long time ms patients were told not to exercise because there was a fear it could exacerbate their symptoms but were finding that if ms patients exercise in a controlled setting it can actually help them with their cognitive function she added ; waterloo iowa ap  irving physical education teacher cory arensdorf introduced his class of fifthgraders wednesday morning to a new twist on the old game of tag

its called food fat attack the healthy runners run from the fat attack taggers who wear jerseys adorned with names such as candy boy nacho dude and french fry girl they attempt to tag the healthy runners who then have to fill their jersey with balls simulating fat cells

how do you get rid of the fat cells one student asked to the delight of arensdorf exercise he shouted to a room full of smiles

the incorporation of mental and physical fitness into nearly all aspects of the daily routine has earned irving elementary statewide recognition as a twotime winner of the healthiest state k12 school award presented by healthpartners unitypoint health

they cant just be physical they have to feel good about who they are before they can learn the lessons of being healthy and taking care of themselves arensdorf told the waterloocedar falls courier

with last years winnings of 5000 the school purchased heart monitors worn like a wrist watch they alert kids throughout the day if they have an increased heart rate unless theyre in gym class they go through the steps theyve learned to calm down including breathing exercises and mindfulness practices

its something that could be revolutionary with kids who have anxiety said irving principal frederick zach zimmerman

coupled with games such as saturated fat ball heartline dribble and nutrition hockey arensdorf keeps students focused on fitness

he doesnt just make games for fun he makes them about learning and having fun fifthgrader jakiyah porter said

nutrition and exercise themes can be seen throughout the school there are water bottle filling stations an urban garden and fruits and vegetables instead of sugary snacks with help from food corps and the black hawk health department last year the school launched its first color run 5k

we are looking to inspire zimmerman said being in a lowincome area if we can do it anyone can

wellness initiatives are coordinated by arensdorf zimmerman and kristin meanywalen mental health coordinator at irving all k5 teachers incorporate lessons on socialemotional learning nutritional health physical health and sleep as part of a program adopted by all waterloo schools

were looking at kids individually giving them what they need zimmerman said including food and water for those who live in poverty just basic needs a lot of our kids dont have  its sad but its a reality so you have to address it

to encourage even more exercise arensdorf introduced the morning run club students wear a scannable badge to track their laps around an outdoor track with a smartphone app the morning exercise club keeps track of exercise indoors during the winter

anywhere from 50 to 200 students show up before school to add laps which are displayed on the wall in the gymnasium

the school has about 460 students enrolled and about 390 of them have scanned into one of the exercise clubs this year arensdorf said

overall the social well being of students has dramatically increased zimmerman said

a father who served time for gangrelated offences has revealed how he became a personal trainer after discovering exercise when he came out of prison

mike purvis 31 of bicester oxfordshire spent just over a year in prison before being released to a hostel in oxford where he turned to the gym to stay out of trouble

living in that hostel it would have been so easy for me to fall back into that lifestyle he said in an interview with femail i had to keep myself busy so i joined a gym and absolutely fell in love with it

in the decade since mike has become a personal trainer a position that he is uniquely suited to because he understands what it takes to overcome adversity and because he weighed almost 19st growing up

mike purvis 31 pictured who lives in bicester revealed how spending time in prison for violent gang crimes inspired him to overhaul his life with a career in fitness

mike has become a personal trainer a position that he is uniquely suited to because he understands what it takes to overcome adversity and because he weighed almost 19st growing up pictured mike as a young man

he said i believe i can reach a lot of people because not only am i an ex convict who turned his life around but im also an ex fat person who changed it around so i know what it takes from both aspects

mike who is also a fighter out of paladin boxing told how he was always getting into trouble growing up

i was drinking in the street doing drugs fighting getting arrested so it was kind of inevitable mike told femail

when i left school i just had no idea what to do i didnt get the grades to do any sort of further education so i just thought what the hell i started going to parties and drinking a lot which led me to that lifestyle

mike appeared at oxford crown court in 2008 when he was sentenced to a total of four years and four months for two offences to run concurrently he was released after serving half the twoandahalf years

mike purvis 31 pictured in the gym spent just over a year in prison before being released to a hostel in oxford where he turned to the gym to stay out of trouble

the fatherofone pictured training a client began to change his mindset while in prison fearing that he would spend the rest of his life serving time for committing crimes

speaking about his sentencing he said my mum cried which was kind of a hard thing to watch obviously it was quite a lot to deal with for my family as one day everything was normal then the police knocked on the door and took me away

im gone for over a year  but we all dealt with it the best we could how else can you deal with anything besides get on with it

mike who spent time in solitary confinement for fighting used his time in prison to reflect on his life and vowed to make a change when he was released

i just knew that when i was finally released if i didnt change the way i lived my life then this will be it for me he continued i would have been in and out of prison my whole life

i also knew how hard it was going to be as its not the easiest of tasks trying to get a job as an exconvict but my whole mindset and attitude towards life changed while i was in prison i was more positive and determined to take on anything

i took advantage of the rehabilitation services that were offered to me that i had previously declined

mike who got maths and english qualifications while in prison found a job working in a factory after leaving which gave him the opportunity to save up to pay for a level two fitness course

mike pictured worked five years as a bricklayer before a friend who was a promoter for a boxing club asked him to step in for a match

i took my english and maths exams again as i knew a lot of jobs on the outside require a basic level of maths and english to even apply

i took an entry level fitness course which is pretty much an induction into the fitness industry and also received support from the probation services regarding housing

when i left prison i was banned from my home town of banbury for the remainder of my licence which was 14 months and so was moved to a hostel in oxford

it was just as hard as i thought it would be trying to get a job nobody wanted to know so i had to sign on to job seekers allowance

living in that hostel without a job in a town where i knew not a single soul with about ten other housemates who were all still getting in trouble drinking and partying it would have been so easy for me to fall back into that lifestyle i had to keep myself busy so i joined a gym and absolutely fell in love with it

mike who is father to fiveyearold darae eventually got a job in a factory to save enough money to study for a gym instructor qualification

mike pictured training a class who once weighed over 18st saved up for his level three qualification to become a personal trainer

he continued to gain my level two i applied for a course online that was being held in birmingham it cost over 1100 so i had to save up and after i completed the course i got a part time job as a fitness instructor at a local gym in banbury called fighting fit

when the gym closed mike spent five years working as a bricklayer before returning to the world of exercise when a friend needed help at a boxing club

he saved up for his level three pt qualification and now works as a selfemployed trainer

he continued ive met all kinds of people from all aspects of life and i have to deal with every client differently what might work with one client might not work with another

im a spin instructor and i also plan to start a fitness class for people who are in similar situations as i was

he also shared a warning for people who found themselves caught up in criminal activity if you do the crime then prepare to do the time this lifestyle will eventually catch up with you and stay with you for the rest of your life ; life is looking a lot better for manchester united since they came back from the winter break

victories against chelsea and watford have put them right back in contention for the top four and manchester citys ban from european competitions for the next two seasons has actually put the red devils in the final champions league qualification spot

they also got past club brugge with ease in the europa league romping to a 50 win in the second leg at old trafford to book their place in the roundof16

it puts them in a healthy position going into their premier league match at everton on sunday

the toffees have improved since carlo ancelotti took charge in december but suffered a defeat in their last outing against arsenal

uniteds last visit to goodison park saw them get slaughtered 40 in april 2019  a poor performance that former red devil gary neville described as rancid

on the positive side the only way is up and man united boss ole gunnar solskjaer will be hoping for a result this time

hell be without the likes of marcus rashford and paul pogba and another injury concern is anthony martial who sat out the win over brugge as he picked up a thigh injury earlier in the week

a scan on friday will give the club an idea about the extent of his injury and whether hell be fit to play on sunday

below you can see how manchester united should line up against everton according to talksportcom

united usually go for a 343 formation for tricky away matches but martials potential absence poses a problem

the frenchman may have three goals in his last three appearances but playing him while carrying an injury wouldnt be a smart move especially given rashford isnt back any time soon

so weve gone for ighalo who against brugge up top and if goals are an issue then martial can always come off the bench

bruno fernandes has reinvigorated united in attack so should obviously start in the no10 role alongside him should be daniel james and juan mata who both played on thursday

scott mctominay marked his return to the firstteam with a goal against brugge but a game at everton could be too intense for a player easing his way back from injury so fred who scored twice should play alongside nemanja matic

david de gea will start in goal and eric baillys return to fitness should see him start alongside captain harry maguire while mainstays at fullback aaron wanbissaka and luke shaw should also get the nod ; man utd staff swiftly ditched a tailored fitness programme for bruno fernandes after the stars impressive physical test results

fernandes joined up with the united squad at a warmweather training camp in marbella immediately after completing his january transfer from sporting lisbon

united went on their winter break shortly after the stars debut against wolves  and the plan was to use the period to bring fernandes up to speed before gradually integrating him into firstteam sessions

the metro report uniteds conditioning department had produced a specific programme for fernandes to follow but scrapped it once they realised he was in immaculate condition

fernandes completed a series of physical tests along with the rest of the squad and ranked among the top three players

and it wasnt just the midfielders conditioning that impressed out in spain as uniteds players were blown away by the talent of their new acquisition

fernandes displayed his quality in warmup drills where united staff were in awe of his quick decisionmaking and pass selection

the 25yearold also demonstrated a keen work ethic staying behind in training each day to practice freekicks with teammate fred

united were initially concerned fernandes may be slow to adapt to the fast pace of the premier league after coming from portugal

but those fears have be allayed already with the star playing a key role and providing two goals and two assists

he has also been praised for his evident leadership skills while gaining plaudits from former united legends

hes come in and hes been a breath of fresh air rio ferdinand said on his youtube channel  theres no heirs and graces and he looks like hes come in and is someone who wants to play football and enjoys his football

hes somebody who is going to have an impact and have an influence on other people it seems hes come in and im seeing improvements in other peoples performances

while fellow exunited great paul scholes told bt sport the fact that nobody has been talking about paul pogba coming back into the team in the last few weeks speaks volumes for what fernandes has brought to the team ; united staff feared fernandes would take some time to adapt to the pace of the premier league but he has hit the ground running since his arrival from sporting lisbon

manchester united were blown away by the immaculate condition of bruno fernandes when he joined the club back in january

the old trafford clubs conditioning staff had drawn up a bespoke fitness programme so the portuguese midfielder could hit the ground running in the premier league after his 47million move from sporting lisbon

but this plan was quickly ripped up during uniteds warm weather training camp in marbella as it became immediately clear fernandes had the necessary fitness levels to integrate with the squad

bruno fernandes has impressed manchester united staff since arriving at old trafford

the portuguese midfielder converts from the spot during uniteds 50 win over club brugge

fernandes has made an excellent start to life at old trafford with his speed of thought in attacking areas giving united an extra gear in games

and according to the metro this is down in part to his high levels of fitness with fernandes ranking in the top three during physical tests in marbella

a source told the newspaper that fernandes teammates have been blown away by the abilities of the clubs new signing

he displays his qualities in warmup drills with united staff impressed with his sharp decision making and pass selection

its called food fat attack the healthy runners run from the fat attack taggers who wear jerseys adorned with names such as candy boy nacho dude and french fry girl they attempt to tag the healthy runners who then have to fill their jersey with balls simulating fat cells

how do you get rid of the fat cells one student asked to the delight of arensdorf exercise he shouted to a room full of smiles

with last years winnings of 5000 the school purchased heart monitors worn like a wrist watch they alert kids throughout the day if they have an increased heart rate unless theyre in gym class they go through the steps theyve learned to calm down including breathing exercises and mindfulness practices

its something that could be revolutionary with kids who have anxiety said irving principal frederick zach zimmerman

coupled with games such as saturated fat ball heartline dribble and nutrition hockey arensdorf keeps students focused on fitness

he doesnt just make games for fun he makes them about learning and having fun fifthgrader jakiyah porter said

drab affairlos blancos ; australian fitness trainer kayla itsines was back on instagram on wednesday as she took to the social media platform to share a photo of herself showing off her gymsculpted figure and encourage her 122 million followers  particularly the women  to keep things simple and avoid succumbing to the pressure of onerous beauty andor health regimens

in her latest instagram upload kayla was photographed in an outdoor setting posing with a tree and some shrubbery in the background and flexing her right bicep as she placed her left hand on her hips and popped her right knee forward the stunner wore a red sports bra that allowed her to flaunt her rockhard midsection pairing it with dark gray shorts that showed off her similarly toned thighs and legs she completed her look with a pair of light blue sneakers and wore her dark hair in a top knot for this particular shoot

while kaylas outfit may have drawn a lot of attention toward her flawless physique her caption was arguably more striking as the trainer took a few moments to discuss how women are often put under tremendous pressure to follow certain beauty diet or exercise plans that take up a lot of time or include a lot of specific rules to follow this she said is why she prefers to keep her fitness programs as simple as possible and why she encourages women to follow her lead and eschew any regimen thats too unrealistic or timeconsuming with no scientific backing of any kind

view this post on instagram

as women we have so much pressure placed on us  were told to follow a timeconsuming beauty regimen for selfcare or to fast for 23 hours a day please dont try to do this  its the worst idea ever were told to wear one cream on our face but we definitely cant use it on our body we need three products just to wash our hair which we have to match exactly to our hair type we get judged on every single thing we do when were raising our children im sorry  what why  the pressure is literally insane   thats why i always want to keep it simple and straightforward   i dont want women to think that they need to follow complicated health and fitness programs and always keep up with the latest fads theyre just adding pressure asking us to do something unrealistic or timeconsuming  and they usually have no scientific basis whatsoever  lets not add more pressure to our lives by following punishing unsustainable programs   i actually want to help women by providing what works and is backed by research and is really simple   train a few times a week eat a wholesome balanced diet and take a realistic approach to health and fitness that you can sustain for your whole life be consistent and you will see results make it your lifestyle but most importantly make it something you can enjoy too at the end of the day you need to be happy with yourself dropthepressure

a post shared by kayla itsines kayla_itsines on feb 25 2020 at 729pm pst

the final two paragraphs of kaylas caption saw her advise other women to stick to the fundamentals  a healthy diet a regular training schedule and a realistic approach to fitness  and do so on a consistent basis she wrapped things up by telling her followers to make sure they enjoy their fitness plans adding a hashtag that summed up all her previous points and encouraged them to drop the pressure

in the seven hours since the new post was uploaded to instagram it has received more than 33000 likes as well as more than 220 comments many of which came from followers who were thankful for her latest dose of fitspiration

amen gushed one instagram user punctuating their comment with a prayinghands emoji

living in that hostel it would have been so easy for me to fall back into that lifestyle he said in an interview with femail i had to keep myself busy so i joined a gym and absolutely fell in love with it

in the decade since mike has become a personal trainer a position that he is uniquely suited to because he understands what it takes to overcome adversity and because he weighed almost 19st growing up

mike purvis 31 pictured who lives in bicester revealed how spending time in prison for violent gang crimes inspired him to overhaul his life with a career in fitness

mike has become a personal trainer a position that he is uniquely suited to because he understands what it takes to overcome adversity and because he weighed almost 19st growing up pictured mike as a young man

he said i believe i can reach a lot of people because not only am i an ex convict who turned his life around but im also an ex fat person who changed it around so i know what it takes from both aspects

mike who is also a fighter out of paladin boxing told how he was always getting into trouble growing up

i was drinking in the street doing drugs fighting getting arrested so it was kind of inevitable mike told femail

when i left school i just had no idea what to do i didnt get the grades to do any sort of further education so i just thought what the hell i started going to parties and drinking a lot which led me to that lifestyle

mike appeared at oxford crown court in 2008 when he was sentenced to a total of four years and four months for two offences to run concurrently he was released after serving half the twoandahalf years

mike purvis 31 pictured in the gym spent just over a year in prison before being released to a hostel in oxford where he turned to the gym to stay out of trouble

the fatherofone pictured training a client began to change his mindset while in prison fearing that he would spend the rest of his life serving time for committing crimes

speaking about his sentencing he said my mum cried which was kind of a hard thing to watch obviously it was quite a lot to deal with for my family as one day everything was normal then the police knocked on the door and took me away

im gone for over a year  but we all dealt with it the best we could how else can you deal with anything besides get on with it

mike who spent time in solitary confinement for fighting used his time in prison to reflect on his life and vowed to make a change when he was released

i just knew that when i was finally released if i didnt change the way i lived my life then this will be it for me he continued i would have been in and out of prison my whole life

i also knew how hard it was going to be as its not the easiest of tasks trying to get a job as an exconvict but my whole mindset and attitude towards life changed while i was in prison i was more positive and determined to take on anything

i took advantage of the rehabilitation services that were offered to me that i had previously declined

mike who got maths and english qualifications while in prison found a job working in a factory after leaving which gave him the opportunity to save up to pay for a level two fitness course

mike pictured worked five years as a bricklayer before a friend who was a promoter for a boxing club asked him to step in for a match

i took my english and maths exams again as i knew a lot of jobs on the outside require a basic level of maths and english to even apply

i took an entry level fitness course which is pretty much an induction into the fitness industry and also received support from the probation services regarding housing

when i left prison i was banned from my home town of banbury for the remainder of my licence which was 14 months and so was moved to a hostel in oxford

it was just as hard as i thought it would be trying to get a job nobody wanted to know so i had to sign on to job seekers allowance

living in that hostel without a job in a town where i knew not a single soul with about ten other housemates who were all still getting in trouble drinking and partying it would have been so easy for me to fall back into that lifestyle i had to keep myself busy so i joined a gym and absolutely fell in love with it

mike who is father to fiveyearold darae eventually got a job in a factory to save enough money to study for a gym instructor qualification

mike pictured training a class who once weighed over 18st saved up for his level three qualification to become a personal trainer

he continued to gain my level two i applied for a course online that was being held in birmingham it cost over 1100 so i had to save up and after i completed the course i got a part time job as a fitness instructor at a local gym in banbury called fighting fit

when the gym closed mike spent five years working as a bricklayer before returning to the world of exercise when a friend needed help at a boxing club

he saved up for his level three pt qualification and now works as a selfemployed trainer

he continued ive met all kinds of people from all aspects of life and i have to deal with every client differently what might work with one client might not work with another

im a spin instructor and i also plan to start a fitness class for people who are in similar situations as i was

he also shared a warning for people who found themselves caught up in criminal activity if you do the crime then prepare to do the time this lifestyle will eventually catch up with you and stay with you for the rest of your life ; if west ham are to stay in the top flight they are going to have to rely heavily on their back line and the elasticity of michail antonios hamstrings

the 31 win against southampton was only the second time all season that the forward has managed to play three games in a row it was easy to imagine at the london stadium on saturday that west ham would not be sitting above the relegation zone by virtue of goal difference if they had been able to use more of his pace and energy this campaign

sadly antonio has spent two spells in the treatment room with thigh injuries which have restricted him to only nine starts this season ; edmonds brandnew barre3 studio is opening its doors thursday march 5 at the former edmonds hardware and paint location in old mill town

working out is an absolute must if you want to live a long healthy and happy life unfortunately as a busy parent it can sometimes be difficult or even downright impossible to fit exercise into your everyday life not only do you have other things that need to be done but your children might make it difficult to either get to the gym or even do a simple workout at home there are many ways for you to get back into an exercise routine without giving it up entirely

find a kidfriendly gym

if youd rather opt for a gym you might want to think about choosing one thats kidfriendly for example the eos gym in santa ana has onsite childcare facilities for kids ages two months to 12 years this allows you to get in a good workout without having to worry about finding a babysitter this makes it easier to lose weight and get fit without your life getting in the way of your goals

find a time that works

one way to get in a good workout is to find a time of day or night that works for you this means looking to see if you should be working out in the morning or in the evening for instance if your kids go off to school in the morning and you have a few hours before you need to be at work you can do your exercise after theyve left many parents find that evenings are the best for working out since they can exercise after the children have gone to bed

get the family involved

a great way to exercise regularly is to get your kids involved and reach fitness goals as a family rather than individually this could be doing an exercise video together that involves dancing and jumping around or going out for a walk together you might even want to invest in buying a few bikes so that you can go out for a bike ride together there are many ways to get the kids involved when it comes to working out and youll find that your entire family benefits from this

make fitness a priority

one reason so many parents struggle to get fit is that they arent making their health a priority this is completely understandable since you have other things to worry about and probably put your own health to the back burner rather than continue to live this way you need to make fitness an absolute priority in your own life this means taking the time to exercise but also committing to working out completely you can use every excuse in the world to avoid exercise but when it comes down to it it is your own health thats on the line and its a lot more important than you might think

exercise at work

if you absolutely do not have the time to exercise at home and cant get to the gym consider working out while on the job for one you can make small changes to how you work to get in some exercise like parking away from your building or taking a walk during your lunch break in some cases you might even have a gym onsite where youll be able to exercise or you might want to put a small piece of workout equipment in the office itself so that you are able to use it whenever necessary ; pune march 01 2020 globe newswire  global preworkout supplements market 2020 research report provides information regarding preworkout supplements market size share trends growth cost structure capacity revenue and forecast 2026 this report also includes the overall and comprehensive study of the preworkout supplements market with all its aspects influencing the growth of the market this report is exhaustive quantitative analyses of the preworkout supplements industry and provides data for making strategies to increase market growth and effectiveness

detailed toc of global preworkout supplements market httpswwwindustryresearchbiztoc15166546 ; it wasnt a full on social justice freak out nobody got cancelled it generated a few headlines and some people on twitter were a little miffed most moved on in a few days

so you might have missed when former biggest loser star jillian michaels took a shot straight at the heart of a debate that most in the media have lost the will to discuss fat versus fit

she did it jan 8 during a digital broadcast at buzzfeed of all places an outlet that actually has a body positivity tag body positivity is the euphemism woke digital netizens have adopted in recent years in order to make obesity  the leading cause of death in america  seem less pernicious indeed even a source of pride

ironically enough if you peruse this buzzfeed tag a frequent featurette is lizzo who just so happened to be the topic of conversation during michaels buzzfeed interview buzzfeeds alex berg walked her right into it too asking michaels what she thought of hollywood celebrating people with different bodies

but why are we celebrating her body michaels responded why does it matter thats what im saying like why arent we celebrating her music cause it isnt going to be awesome if she gets diabetes im just being honest theres never a moment where im like im so glad shes overweight

it was the perfect confluence of reality michaels is a fan of lizzo but pulled up short of calling her healthy that kind of nuance is not appreciated in the woker recesses of the internet the backlash was swift but michaels  a professional fitness instructor  was unwilling to budge

theres nothing beautiful about clogged arteries she said to people magazine soon after im not saying you are not a beautiful person im not saying youre not physically beautiful but im saying being obese is not a beautiful thing its actually a sad thing

while most people took offense to the way michaels talked about lizzos seemingly morbid obesity everyone predictably went on ignoring a bigger conversation unless michelle obama is pitching healthy meals for school kids the media has no interest in aggressively covering obesity

obesity is associated with an increased risk of some of the leading causes of death including heart disease stroke diabetes and cancer according to the cdc a columbia university study published in 2013 found that obesity is the cause of one in five deaths of american adults aged 4085

michaels chose to focus on lizzos talents instead of her body and somehow was crucified by the media for it

her comments struck a chord with people who preach selfacceptance but shouldnt fitness be a part of accepting your body shouldnt we be concerned about the health of other people

we should be looking at fitness and fitness encompasses the whole individual and somebody can be overfat and still fit dixie stanforth told the daily caller

it turns out having strength and stamina doesnt mean much if youre obese by body mass index bmi standards in the united states a bmi of 30 or more is considered obese someone who is overfat but fit an nfl lineman for example still is at a high risk to develop heart disease

your average offensive lineman in the nfl is obese but theres no question about their strength and stamina they are pro athletes overall still they suffer similar risks that average americans do when it comes to obesity experts tell us

players who played tackle guard center or defensive end positions in the nfl have a higher risk of dying of cardiovascular disease compared with the general population according to a study published by the american journal of cardiology

the cdc has also studied the phenomenon and came to the conclusion that players who had a bmi of 30 or higher while playing in the nfl were twice as likely to die from heart disease later in life in fact defensive linemen had a 42 higher risk of dying from heart disease than the general population

the idea that someone can be fit even while overweight has been discussed heavily in the media some researchers argue that how much weight that you carry on your body does not affect your health while some say its true most studies show that its very unlikely

the measures of fitness and fatness are both influenced by how much you weigh tammy chang md and caroline r richardson md wrote together in an article published by university of michigan health lab because of the way fitness is calculated for two people with the same oxygentransferring power weighing more typically means lower fitness

a higher bmi has been directly connected to a higher risk for stroke heart attacks and high blood pressure according to a study published by european heart journal in march of 2018 the study watched 300000 people who did not have heart disease that were normal weight overweight or obese by bmi standards

in fact they discovered that the risk increases the more fat a person carries around his or her waist an article published by the harvard health publishing journal wrote

for instance among the men who started with a 32inch waist and a bmi between 22 and 23 which is considered healthy those who added five inches to their waist size raised their heart disease risk by 16 the article continued

michaels comments should have started a wider conversation about obesity but instead the media memoryholed the idea that you can discuss health concerns in a positive way

expressing concerns about fatness is a kind of bias not some brave truthtelling vox writer katelyn esmonde wrote as a subheadline in an article titled what celeb trainer jillian michaels got wrong about lizzo and body positivity

while weight bias does exist we cant shy away from a conversation about health having concern for someones health isnt a bad thing and theres ways to keep the dialogue positive

because we dont want to be accused of being biased we respond you know we overprotect and we overguard anything that we might say stanforth said its tough they are tough questions because our physical being is so closely tied with our identity that its really a challenging conversation to have

the conversation we need to be having is about who people are she added the value they have is not their size or their shape because what happens when you get cancer and you get really sick and that goes away

body positivity includes health it starts with selfacceptance and then it should move towards health according to physiologist and accountability coach omari bernard

once we accept and embrace our body were able to move forward and say alright now what changes do i wanna make on my body bernard told the daily caller

the media doesnt seem to take issue with talking about childhood obesity we have conversations about kids who are overweight but we arent allowed to have conversations about adults who are overweight nobody wants to be offensive

yet obesity costs americans roughly 190 billion in healthcare costs per year according to a study published by cornell university

obese children become obese adults stanforth said

i think that i would think we would benefit from a shift away from the focus on the external and to continue to talk about obesity as a health concern not an aesthetic concern she added

i dont care what somebody looks like if theyre healthy and fit and so if we could just make that shift i think we could talk about it through the lifespan and we wouldnt have to walk on eggshells when youre talking about adult obesity stanforth explained i think some of the bias issues would definitely be mitigated we could quit being focused on that external aesthetic approach

bernard said michaels comments were misread

what she was saying was just like lets celebrate her music because shes a talented human being spreading love and acceptance and strength to women that may feel ashamed bernard said i think it was misread i think she was just saying that its two different things and i agree with jillian is that health is important and it needs to be addressed and we cannot sit here and like lie to ourselves that health is not an issue because if you look around obesity and the epidemic causes a myriad of things ; we realized that we are among a group of women that make up a large part of the fitness community but still feel ignored and misunderstood said the gibson sisters

sister duo cornelia and julia gibson are on a mission to make the wellness space more inclusive according to black enterprise the two women joined forces to create a fitness product company where black women could see themselves reflected

the company  dubbed toned by bagged em  features an array of yoga mats that include imagery of women of color practicing yoga the three mats that are a part of the toned yoga mats collection includes illustrations of a black woman sketched by their mother the woman is donning coily tresses and fitness gear while practicing different poses the mats are the first product to be released under their collection the sisters  who started their business after raising over 2000 within two months through a kickstarter campaign  say their mission is to empower women of color along their wellness journeys and work towards increasing the representation of black women in fitness products

our own experiences maintaining our health and physique has lent us firsthand experience on how hard it is to remain encouraged and motivated to stay in shape read a statement on their website we realized that we are among a group of women that make up a large part of the fitness community but still feel ignored and misunderstood that is why we created toned by baggedem we identify with a plethora of issues that often impede a womans fitness motivation like body image issues hair maintenance and sometimes just plain ol lack of energy our ultimate goal is to create a brand that tells women that we are most beautiful when we push ourselves

everything seems to be trending in general to technology to apps says shaw

the app which the company describes as a diet designer and coach tells subscribers what to eat based on their schedule and their health goals offering features such as meal planning and a shopping list shaw has been selling it for 1499 a month or 14999 per year after a free twoweek trial

nick shaw is turning his fitness and diet coaching business renaissance periodization into a tech   firm with a new app rp diet

were slowing becoming a tech company even more than a fitness company says shaw

in building a milliondollar oneperson business shaw made it into an elite but growing group of solo entrepreneurs there were 36984 non employer firms  those with no payroll  that hit 1 million to 249 million in revenue in 2017 the us census bureau found that number is up by 38 since 2011

some milliondollar oneperson business owners prefer to keep their business to a boutique size others realize once they hit that point that they want to keep growing their company and see where they can take things

that was shaws decision he hired his wife lori to help him in 2015 and with the company growing rapidly began staffing up in 2016 he now relies on 25 coaches  20 phds and five registered dietitians  who are 1099 contractors and built his support staff to 10 employees last year was his sixth year of generating revenue above 1 million annually at the profitable firm

here are the growth strategies that have been driving the companys growth

think scalably from the start shaw who earned a bachelors degree in sports management from the university of michigan in 2009 originally targeted athletes such as bodybuilders as customers when he went into business offering sports coaching however he realized early that service businesses like coaching have a builtin limit there are only so many hours in a week to sell and that limitation would still exist for any additional coaches he brought on as a father of two he wanted to build a business that allowed plenty of time for his family so he began looking for a way to grow the company that wasnt dependent on how many hours anybody put in

his answer was to productize what he was selling turning the knowledge and intellectual property behind his business into products working with an exercise physiology consultant he created a product  prebuilt diets  that allowed customers to tap into his advice without working with him directly customers were able to customize the diets based on their gender weight and fitness goals he packaged these as the 3monthdiet plan which sells for 600 and an enhanced plan that includes training by email or social media chat for 850

shaw also introduced a simpler offering a diet template delivered as a pdf file to help people lose or gain weight depending on their goals which sells for 109 meanwhile he published several ebooks such as the renaissance kitchencookbook recovering from training and renaissance woman a fitness guide for women which sell for 14 to 37

as customer demand took off he used the customer relationship management software infusionsoft to manage the process of sending out orders that enabled him to keep up with orders from tens of thousands of customers worldwide

renaissance periodizations app is designed to help users make healthy food choices

keep making what works even better as customers became more heavily dependent on their mobile phones do to just about everything shaw realized there was another opportunity in front of him developing an app

the challenge was taking what customers loved about offerings like his diet templates  along with constructive feedback  and translating that to a tech product we have a lot of people who are dedicated followers of our pdfs and even to our old excel files says shaw we have to prove the app is significantly better to those clients to make them switch

in 2016 he and a team of tech contractors began working on app development they focused on adding features that clients had requested like having the app do any math involved in the diet

its one of those things where you have to have realistic expectations and timelines especially if you are getting into something new says shaw it takes a long time to really get up and running even to make changes and edit takes a lot longer than you would think i tried to keep that in mind and be really patient you dont want to rush it out and have it not be any good

then again he realized he couldnt wait forever nothing is going to be perfect he says you have to make it good enough to get it out and you need customers to be able to freely express their critiques

since releasing the app hes made a number of edits in response to reader feedback probably every month there are going to be updates he says

fortunately the app has been racking up high ratings with 45 stars on google play and 46 stars on the itunes store thats exactly where hed hoped it would be i took a look at the top 10 apps in this space notes shaw if youre around 45 youre very good

to reach new customers shaw has along the way built a strong presence for renaissance periodization on facebook where the brand has 119000 followers and instagram where it has more than 167000 followers that has given him a natural market for his tech products now we have to show them how awesome the app is says shaw

partner for growth in running his company shaw realizes that one of the greatest challenges facing his customers is todays lifestyle  where fewer people do physical work  and the standard american diet which some in the nutrition community describe by the acronym sad

food is more delicious easier and more convenient than ever says shaw all of the technology we have makes people do a little bit less people are expending fewer calories and eating more its no real surprise why the obesity rates are going up

to make it easier for customers to make healthy choices shaw partnered with ascent protein a provider of protein powders and supplements and trifecta nutrition which makes healthy meals and ships them vacuumpacked to customers doorsteps on ice packs it eliminates any excuses for not being successful says shaw

of course not everyone can afford to order premade meals to support those who would rather take the diy approach shaws wife has created a popular series of cookbooks including a vegan cookbook

were always trying to improve says shaw how can we make better products how can we help more people were listening to customer feedback ; as part of decentralization of service brta is developing a guideline in this regard expecting to complete it by june this year

in order to reduce the sufferings of vehicle owners the government is planning to outsource operators who will check the fitness of motor vehicles at circle offices of bangladesh road transport authority brta all across bangladesh

as part of decentralization of service brta is developing a guideline in this regard expecting to complete it by june this year said officials

according to a recent world bank report delivering roads safety in bangladesh the brta plans to register and license motor workshops in accordance with their capacity assessed in terms of capability of testing equipment and space to conduct vehicle test runs

according to the report agrade workshops will have authority to check the fitness of heavy vehicles like buses trucks and minibuses bgrade workshops will be able to check suvs and sedans while cgrade workshops will be authorised to handle motorcycles and autorickshaws

brta director operation sitangshu shekhar biswas told dhaka tribune that they are preparing the guideline to outsource operators for checking fitness of motor vehicles

the operators will only check the fitness and submit reports online brta will finally issue the certificates he said

however the official said operator categories have not been finalized yet

the ministry of road transport and bridges has decided that motor vehicle fitness tests would be outsourced to private entities as brta fails to do it properly

according to the decision only designated motor workshops will issue vehicle fitness certificates

however a seven member committee recommended only checking the fitness the committee was formed in august 2018 following a 2011 decision of the road transport and bridges ministry

brta director road safety sk md mahbuberabbani told the dhaka tribune we are avoiding third party organizations like workshops or garages issuing fitness certificates as there is a chance of malpractice or abuse of power

many developed countries including australia and canada use private entities for checking the fitness of motor vehicles and issuing certificates under the supervision of concerned authorities

commending the decision bangladesh road transport owners association secretary general khandakar enayet ullah said currently they lose valuable time waiting in line for the whole day at the two circle offices in the capital for vehicle fitness tests

the brta is responsible for the inspection and fitness certification of vehicles after checking 42 items but it is an uphill battle with only 41 inspectors who face the enormous task of examining the fitness of more than two million vehicles in the country

according to the brta more than 55000 vehicles have not had their vehicle fitness certificate renewed for more than 10 years

many vehicle owners are reluctant to bring their vehicles in for fitness tests because of the long lines

under these circumstances many transport owners collect certificates through brokers without getting their vehicles checked

prof dr shamsul hoque of the civil engineering department at buet said what brta does in the name of fitness checking is a mockery

he recommended the authority enlist only skilled institutions for fitness tests and ensure accountability

further initiatives by the government

the government also plans to develop infrastructure and bring new technology for testing fitness of motor vehicles to meet the rapid growth of motor vehicle purchases

brta is developing a vehicle inspection centre vic in mirpur beside its regional office

a tender will be floated soon to develop the 12lane capacity vic in mirpur it will be operated by a third party organization but fitness certificates will be issued by brta said mahbuberabbani

all motorized vehicles are liable to annual inspection and road tax with the exception of twowheel motorcycles and private cars which are not more than five years old inspections are mainly conducted visually with no automated assistance in 1999 under an adb project five semiautomatic vics were established  two in dhaka and one each in chittagong khulna and rajshahi adb 2007

however technical issues hindered their effective operation the government plans to establish 21 new automated centres for testing both vehicle fitness and emissions within the next five years the plan includes the rehabilitation of four of the five original semiautomatic centres

apart from the undertaken project the government plans to develop vics in every district

we have decided to issue fitness certificates from every district after building the inspection centres said obaidul quader on february 5 during a press briefing at his office

on the same day the road transport and bridges ministry issued a circular saying private car owners will get a two year instead of a one year fitness certificate from now on

the government has been taking such initiatives to bring discipline to the system said brta director mahbuberabbani ; everyone in bollywood is aware of malaika aroras love for fitnessthe actress makes sure to visit the gym daily no matter what here are a few tips to achieve a body like mala

lees lost the ball to rams forward chris martin in the 24th minute and failed to recover his ground as lawrence bagged his second of the afternoon

the owls produced a lacklustre first half display to enter the break three goals down and despite an improved second period they never really threatened to get back into the game

lees was hooked at halftime for dominic iorfa who produced an altogether stronger display in an improved owls second half

fletcher making his first start since sustaining a knee injury in their fa cup win at brighton on january 4 was replaced at halftime by josh windass kadeem harris exited in just the 38th minute and was replaced by connor wickham

on the reasons behind his captains removal monk said his performance wasnt good enough yes he made the mistake but then afterwards he didnt respond to that which i expect

you make the changes fletchers one i spoke to him just before halftime and he was tired obviously steven isnt fully fit and obviously hes come back in a needs must situation

that was more precautionary but the other two were to try to make a change tactically to try and give us more impetus and fight back in that second half

we were the better team in that second half but it was too little too late with the first half that we had

it was a very unfortunate first goal but to compound that with really poor mistakes thats not good enough ; the model looked incredible in her tiny twopiece

shes known it for nine years shes known since she was 3 years old wade said along this way weve asked questions and weve learned but shes known

my daughter was my first interaction when it comes to having to deal with this conversation wade added about being the parent to a lgbt child hopefully im dealing with it the right way some people feel that im not but inside our home we see the smile on her face we see the confidence that shes able to walk around and be herself and thats when you know youre doing right

i love hiit and i believe many people would benefit from introducing it into their training routines that being said people need to understand what it actually is and know how to implement it properly

it stands for high intensity interval training there are many benefits to training this way including burning a lot of calories in a short amount of time boosting your metabolic rate after exercise helping you to lose fat reducing your standing heartrate and blood pressure and reducing your blood sugar levels

great right the problem is lots of people are doing it wrong the key is in the name especially intensity and interval when i see people doing what they believe to be hiit workouts  even with dedicated hiit trainers  i very rarely see any hiit actually happening what i see is circuit training which has its place but is a different less intense style of workout

read more greed film review steve coogan sets out to prove greed is not good

hiit essentially condenses a challenging workout into a short amount of time within this time you need to really push yourself to see the benefits high intensity doesnt just mean getting a bit sweaty and out of breath it means pushing yourself to around 90100 per cent of your maximum effort for no more than 20 seconds at a time you then repeat this a number of times with a longer rest between each interval if youre incorporating weights into a hiit workout you need to think carefully about the volume being lifted aiming for a weight thats close to something you could only safely lift once throwing a 3kg dumbbell around for 30 minutes does not count as intense

have you ever pushed yourself to this intensity its extremely uncomfortable which means people often shy away it puts a huge amount of stress on the body and its something i would only recommend for people with a bit of experience in the gym

the interval part is also crucial a common training technique is 20 seconds on 10 seconds off and people mistake this as interval training in fact the interval in hiit refers to your heart rate its about working with your bodys recovery times so when youre in the work phase your heart rate should be at 90100 per cent of your maximum effort for a period of around 20 seconds you should then take an interval until your heart rate comes right back down

this is usually along the lines of 13 or 25 in practice this might be 20 seconds of burpees followed by a 50 second rest your heart rate should be a series of spikes throughout your workout and if youre just getting started wearing a heart rate monitor is basically essential in order to keep track

time is always a big factor in peoples fitness journeys which makes hiit particularly effective instead of working longer you can work smarter taking advantage of short intervals of high intensity exercise but dont overdo it you should only schedule in two or three hiit sessions a week with at least 48 hours between sessions to allow your energy stores to replenish and muscle tissue to repair

you can still train the day after a hiit session but it should be moderate intensity using different muscle groups or movement patterns

an easy way to get started with your own hiit workout is using the rower and a pair of dumbbells row as hard as you can for 20 seconds rest for 50 then perform dumbbell thrusters for 20 seconds select a weight thats challenging you should struggle to finish 10 reps repeat this format five times  the workout should take no longer than 20 minutes do it properly and regularly and youll really start to see results

a medical practitioners tribunal service hearing in manchester examined whether his conviction meant his fitness to practise was impaired

the hearing was told dr sadler had reported himself to the general medical council gmc after he was told he had been charged 

sarah barlow for the gmc said the conviction was a serious criminal offence and carried with it the possibility of members of public being put at significant risk

dr sadler had given evidence as to why the offences occurred but could not provide an explanation as to why he got into the car in the first place she said

catherine stock for dr sadler said he accepted his actions fell seriously below the expected standards of a doctor but it had been a oneoff single incident in october 2018 with no evidence of repeated behaviour

she told the hearing the issues leading up to the conviction had been addressed he had carried on with his career and was coping well with the stresses and strains of being a junior doctor

tribunal chairman david clark said the tribunal noted there is no risk to patients in this case there are no concerns with regard to dr sadlers clinical practice the tribunal has seen no evidence the care of his patients was put at risk or his ability compromised

dr sadlers actions brought the profession into disrepute and breached a fundamental tenet of the profession by impacting adversely on public trust however dr sadler has given the tribunal a detailed explanation of the events that led to the incident in question

the tribunal has determined dr sadlers fitness to practise is not currently impaired by reason of his conviction ; the strava fitness app now has the ability to sync data from workouts to the users apple watch due to integration with apple health the compatibility features also mean that data from the strava fitness app can be sent to an apple watch data syncing with strava can be from up to a maximum of 30 days old and users can also select workouts they would like to share and even include photos and titles

the women trainee government clerks in the city of surat in gujarat say they were also checked for pregnancy

an official report on the alleged incident is expected within 15 days

it comes days after college students living in a gujarat hostel said they were forced to remove their underwear to prove they were not menstruating

the latest complaint was lodged on thursday by an employee union of the surat municipal corporation smc a civic body where the group of about 100 women worked

according to the union the incident took place during physical tests at a governmentrun hospital the surat municipal institute of medical education and research smimer the tests are mandatory for anyone who wants to continue working after their threeyear probation

the women allege that they were forced to stand naked in a room together in groups of 10 during the invasive finger tests which were conducted by female doctors

they added that the rooms door was not properly closed and a curtain was the only thing blocking the view from the outside

their union said it was not opposed to the tests but rather the highly deplorable methods used by the hospital

i have never heard such a test on women employees anywhere else said union head ahmed shaikh in an interview with the times of india newspaper if they had any doubt about an employees health they should have got tests in an acceptable manner

in an interview with the bbcs gujarati service hospital dean vandana desai said that to date smimer had carried out nearly 4000 physical tests without a single complaint

in the fitness test we will follow all the rules so there is no doubt about it she added

the citys mayor jagdish patel told pti news agency that the issue was very serious

we will take strict action against the culprits if the allegations levelled by the women staffers are found to be true he added ; chelsea manager frank lampard has said midfielder ngolo kante will miss up to three weeks with a muscle injury but striker tammy abraham could return against tottenham hotspur on saturday

lampards team have been hit with injuries to key players in recent weeks and he offered an update on the duo in his prematch press conference on friday

ngolo is not fit he has got a muscle injury similar to the one he came off recently against arsenal with hopefully he will be back in three weeks something around that

tammy abraham has trained the last two days at probably about 70 per cent he hasnt trained much recently he is in the squad again but i have to make a decision on whether he is fit

kantes injury will be a blow to lampard ahead of some crucial fixtures both in the premier league and the uefa champions league

it means lampard is likely to partner jorginho with mateo kovacic in central midfield as the duo have impressed together for the blues in 201920

kante has been a vital player for chelsea since joining from leicester city july 2016 but has struggled with injury this season and the blues have coped well in his absence they have won 875 per cent of their premier league games without him in the team according to goals nizaar kinsella

lampard will be hoping to have topscorer abraham available for the visit of tottenham the 22yearold has 15 goals in all competitions but has been out of action since the 22 draw with leicester city

squawka football highlighted his importance to the team

lampard will look to either michy batshuayi or olivier giroud if abraham is not deemed fit and the blues boss said the frenchman is ready to make just his third premier league start

dont get discouraged by how far you have to go on the right i was 3 months into this journey and i just took it one day at a time i honestly had no idea that i would end up where i am today i just wanted to be off my medication i can remember that getting down to the 150s was a pretty impossible dream when i finally reached 156 lbs in the summer of 2017 i was worried that if i lost any more weight i would look flabby and frail michelle asked me to trust her and just be patient with the process a year later 2018 i was in the 140s pretty comfortably and still seeing some exciting changes i thought that would be as good as it gets  now here i am yet another year later and comfortably in the 130s michelle now tells me that she plans for me to be in the 120s by next fall just by continuing slowly the way weve been going that still seems impossible to me but i now know to just trust the process   have a wonderful holiday season everyone love yourself enough to make the changes you need to have the health you desire   transformation diet weightlosstips weightloss fitover70

much like the chemical release of exercise dance music is spiritlifting and dopamineenhancing but even a playlist of your most calming galvanising or euphoric tunes cant make a soulless halfhour on the treadmill any less painful but what if you could capture the mental and physical benefits of electronic music while retaining the irreverent vivacity offered by the dancefloor

libby bawden coordinates hiit the floor  a calorieburning workout session based on the high impact interval training you may have seen offered at your local gym while hiit seeks to raise your metabolism sculpt your muscles and decrease your heart rate blood pressure and blood sugar even 2448 hours after the session ends libby prides her class on its immersive rave experience complete with live djs mixing drum and bass its heartpumping exercise set in the uncanny environment of motion twice a fortnight

the music we listen to helps drive us through our workouts libby explains but i was always so uninspired by gym playlists but with drum and bass i feel i can just keep going  im often running over the 60 minutes because i get totally lost in it i love to see the crowd when the bass drops and you can actually see the energy spread through the room

while cagerattling clubgym hybrids are undoubtedly a great way to get moving if youre so inclined electronic music and movement can also be bewitching and tranquilising up until recently hamilton house offered techno yoga  a class prized by 24yearold niamh who would frequent the class on weekend mornings to quell her hangover i loved the rhythms and movements as i felt the bad energies from the night before evaporated techno can be spiritual and i felt this practice was a perfect marriage of the industrial and the soul

though the classes are now defunct in bristol the medium is still going strong in berlin  the mecca of the genre speaking to rob bennett who runs techno yoga in the german capital he sees it as not a workout but as concentrated and precise  a partly free movement merging into dance

whether he or his colleague crawford mccubbin are discovering dynamism in donato dozzy or rrose the sounds favoured are deep and minimal where space and frequencies are foregrounded true yoga as it was originally taught is a movement meditation and hypnotic techno music is conducive to deep meditative states whilst techno yoga might seem to be a radical departure from traditional yoga it remains true to ancient yogic aspirations  being a meditative centring discipline where healing in the sense of becoming whole or connecting with the source was the main focus

and as any dance music devotee would know its connection that lies at its heart no matter where you find it or how you choose to consume it ive had people say that theyve never felt comfortable at a gym or workout classes libby says but here they feel safe included and actually part of a family i think drum and bass more than any other genre really fosters that whole family feel welcoming everyone

the first instance was seen amidst the opening ceremony of psl 2020 where the host was relentlessly mocked most notably on social media for basically lacking the required communication skills and speaking in a bizarre fashion

the heartless bullying first compelled the poor host to tell all those bullying him to not be jealous and actually work hard in life like he has and the next day called the perpetrators out for being their heartless callous selves

the second instance of bullying was seen in the opening match between quetta gladiators and islamabad united where an athlete was mocked was being body positive the athlete was jeered during the field with harsh comments coming from the crowd and on social media

the athlete however had the last laugh making a match winning contribution which reminded his critics that no one  especially those athletes making bundles of money through physical performances  should be judged on their physique

this is a lesson for all of us to be nice people do good to others and not say anything bad to anyone ; fitness powerhouse kayla itsines trained her chiseled arms in the most recent video on her instagram page with dumbbells in hand and dressed in a red sports bra and loosefitting black shorts the brunette beauty started the workout with a series of bicep curls into a type of overhead press called the arnold press

she then moved on to doing side raises and recommended doing 12 reps of this exercise in the caption of the post bentover rows came next which required her to lean forward at the waist and pull the dumbbells toward her

kayla remained in the same position for the next exercise reverse flys but with this exercise she pulled the dumbbells out to her sides and kept her elbows bent

next kayla knocked out the last exercise in the circuit a set of in and out pushups this variation ressembled the standard version of the exercise except that it also required kayla to kick out her legs with each repetition

the clip has been viewed over 180000 times since its upload in the comments section fans showered kayla with lots of compliments

you look stronger and more confident than ever before one instagram user wrote

wow kayla you are more ripped than i have even seen you another remarked

you grow more beautiful with each passing day a third commented

but several of the commenters had questions for kayla and one fan had a key complaint that called out kayla for not making her routine accessible to people at lower fitness levels

i really wish that there were appropriate modifications i cancelled the sweat app for that very reason a fourth commenter wrote not everyone is physically capable of some of these movements

kayla hasnt responded to the comment as of this writing

while kayla trained her arms in a workout video posted on her instagram page in her workout video before this one she did an obstacle course inspired circuit that trained her entire body during the workout the motherofone dashed around her gym as she completed exercises like box jumps bentover rows pushups and more

as a trainer one of my favorite things to do in the gym with my clients is to set up an obstacle style circuit she wrote in the caption this is also a great way to work out with a group of friends

rovers hope that joe rothwell will be in contention to feature when stoke city arrive at ewood park on wednesday night

the extra day break with rovers not playing their midweek fixture until wednesday should give the 24yearold more chance to be involved providing he can come through training in the leadup to the game

rothwell has missed rovers last five matches with a hamstring problem which forced him off at half time in the win over qpr on january 28

mowbray had expected the attacking midfielder to miss the whole of february with the injury in another blow to rovers attacking options

but having welcomed back sam gallagher and joe rankincostello to fitness following groin and hamstring problems respectively mowbray hopes for good news on rothwell next week

his return would boost rovers options yet still with gallagher replacing harry chapman on the bench at brentford while despite travelling rankincostello missed out on the 18

the plan is that hes going to train on monday and then well see how he comes through that mowbray said

hopefully he might have an opportunity to be on the bench on wednesday if he comes through the two days training

well wait and see but if hes fit and flying then we might put him in the team

its good to have a few coming back as was the case with gallagher and if we can get rothwell back then that will be another positive for us

rovers are continuing to monitor the calf injury which derrick williams is currently carrying with an eye on the possible suspension for darragh lenihan who is one yellow card away from a two match ban

the irishman would need to get through three more games without a yellow card if hes to avoid serving a suspension ; england start their womens t20 world cup campaign today with a tricky group b encounter against south africa at the waca but even before facing a ball they will be in good spirits for the fact that australia  hosts holders and overwhelming

he came on for a late cameo in the 00 draw against brighton at st james park carroll would go on playing the role of lategame substitute over the next few months during that time he missed two matches through minor injuries

andy was handed his first start of the season in the 20 win at sheffield united in december

he got his first assist of the season flicking on a long ball to jonjo shelvey who despite the offside flag being raised calmly passed the ball into the back of the net var would rule the goal onside

however since he injured his hip early this year andy has played just 40 minutes in two substitute appearances what was looking like a promising season for the returning geordie has turned into one of frustration

steve bruce was asked about andys contract situation recently it is believed that if he makes 20 appearances it will trigger another years extension andy has made 14 appearances so far but only 2 of those in the last two months

this is what steve bruce had to say as published in the chronicle

i have not thought about it really the big thing is to just get fit for andy

it has been the story for a couple of years

were not going to give a time scale it was a freak thing he kicked a ball and jumped for a ball and hurt himself

thankfully again its not his ankle

while it isnt his ankle its still another long layoff for the geordie striker just two months ago andy was well on his way to making 20 appearances this season

however there are just 11 league games left as well as an important fa cup match hopefully andy can make it back in the next few weeks and play a significant part in the remainder of the season ; tae bo fitness

ill tell you one thing we had better be promoted after all this because if we dont go up after all the decisions that the club have made or havent made depending on the situation then my head might explode

i spoke yesterday about the latest injury news surrounding one of leeds january signings jeankevin augustin and how it doesnt paint the club or indeed the player in a good light now it turns out we could be dealing with the same situation all over again with another one of our signings

according to a report from football insider the reason ian poveda hasnt been managing to get much game time for leeds united at the moment is wait for it because his fitness levels arent up to the standards that marcelo bielsa wants them to be

why

why did we bring in players if they werent ready to help us out straight away isnt that the whole point in the january transfer window to get players to help you in your fight for promotionrelegation rather than looking longterms and how they might help you further down the road

i said when he was in the latter stages of completing his move to elland road that this deal didnt look very promising in my eyes and after just over a month since he signed for us and zero minutes accumulated this deal is looking more and more like its going to go down as a complete and utter waste of time just take a look at our results in early february eight points dropped which could prove crucial at the end of the season all because we brought in someone who wasnt fit and ready enough to help us from he get go

as i said if we dont get promoted this january window much like last year with the failure to sign daniel james will be a huge part of the narrative hopefully it doesnt come to that but theres that bit in the back of my head that thinks it will be ; for more years than i can remember the end of the month of february marks the end of my favourite death watch

i know this sounds morbid but stay your judgment and allow me to finish around the end of this month is when the surviving new year resolutions die

during the first week of january implementing resolutions is marked with the gusto of a person starting off on the road to canaan it is advisable in your own interests to get out of this persons way if you think it cant be done but going to canaan is a very long and demanding journey and it requires continuous replenishment of faith ; this article belongs to the special issue unconventional methods for particle swarm optimization surfing in rough waters is not always as fun as wave riding the big one similarly in optimization problems fitness landscapes with a huge number of local optima make the search for the global optimum a hard and generally annoying game computational intelligence optimization metaheuristics use a set of individuals that surf across the fitness landscape sharing and exploiting pieces of information about local fitness values in a joint effort to find out the global optimum in this context we designed surf a novel surrogate modeling technique that leverages the discrete fourier transform to generate a smoother and possibly easier to explore fitness landscape the rationale behind this idea is that filtering out the high frequencies of the fitness function and keeping only its partial information ie the low frequencies can actually be beneficial in the optimization process we prove our theory by combining surf with a settings free variant of particle swarm optimization pso based on fuzzy logic called fuzzy selftuning pso specifically we introduce a new algorithm named f3stpso which performs a preliminary exploration on the surrogate model followed by a second optimization using the actual fitness function we show that f3stpso can lead to improved performances notably using the same budget of fitness evaluations ; a new year brings with it the promise of a new beginning for people looking to make a lifestyle change but resolutions to get in shape physically can fade fast

campus fitness facilities often flood with students looking to get fit for the new year but the numbers drop fast according to previous lantern reporting however fitness instructors and enthusiasts at the university can offer advice on how to stick with goals for the new decade

for mitchell miceli personal training coordinator at the rpac making plans and establishing consistency is a way to stick with fitness

with whatever program you set out for set goals and benchmarks miceli said as long as you have something to strive for it helps you actually reach those goals

alexis loebick a thirdyear in arts management is following this tip she said she plans to maintain a routine as opposed to toning specific body parts she said her mentality is focused more on her overall health

the new year symbolizes a fresh start and a new semester loebick said if i add fitness as a priority to my routine at the beginning of the year im making a point to see it through for the rest of the semester

she added that she has a goal of working out four to five days a week during the semester in order to build her endurance ultimately she said she wants to be able to run for more than 30 minutes without stopping by spring

the new year definitely pushed me to get back into a fitness routine loebick said i love using the new year as a motivator to jumpstart what i might have let die down in the past year

mara sanderow a firstyear in industrial and systems engineering who recently became a fitness instructor at ohio state said resolutions can become longterm fitness habits if set for reasons centered around making your body healthier

these goals tend to last longer when people find a healthy balance and fitness exercises they enjoy sanderow said

miceli said it is recommended that people exercise for about 150 minutes a week which could be distributed monday through friday for about 30 minutes a day exercises such as walking jogging or going to the gym can accomplish that goal ; pamela showed off the damage that the bird caused

german fitness model pamela reif was trying to enjoy a peaceful yoga session outdoors when she was attacked by a crow unfortunately because she was wearing a tiny bikini that left a lot of her skin exposed she didnt escape her close encounter with the brazen bird unscathed

on friday pamela took to instagram to share the wild video of the crow attack with her 46 million instagram followers the 23yearold fitness enthusiast was shown sporting a hot pink bikini her bandeaustyle top had thin shoulder straps and her bottoms appeared to be a classic thong design with highcut leg openings

pamela was warming up for her workout by doing a few breathing exercises she inhaled and exhaled as she raised her arms up over her head and lowered them making large sweeping arcs out to her sides she then began stretching by leaning over and placing the palms of her hands on the ground she had spread her legs further apart and was bending over to grasp her left foot with both hands when the crow swooped down

pamelas avian attacker dove down and scraped its sharp claws across her back before swooping back up into the air the fitness model immediately hopped up and began feeling her back with her hands as she moved toward the camera

pamela spoke in german after the attack but she added english subtitles to her video she described the feeling of the bird on her back as wet after gasping and expressing shock over the crows behavior she resumed her workout

pamelas instagram post included a photo of the carnage the crow caused the bird left multiple scratch marks on her lower back including a very long one that drew blood

according to pamelas geotag her painful animal encounter took place during her stay in the maldives

vardy missed the surprise defeat to norwich with the recurrence of a calf problem his third injury since the turn of the year

it is a concern weve spoken around that with him and the medical team said rodgers

but its something that we hope will clear up soon ; barcelona face real madrid in el clasico on sunday night and the result could be decisive in the outcome of this seasons la liga title battle

zinedine zidanes side trail the catalan giants by two points heading into this crunch meeting after they slipped up last weekend

see more luis suarez hints at approval of barcelona pursuing ace with 111m release clause

however both sides were left disappointed in the champions league in midweek and so theyll be hoping to get back to winning ways and give themselves a major boost in what should be a thrilling encounter between two top sides

the initial pressure and focus will be on the two coaches and the starting lineups that they go with and according to sport there could be two key changes from quique setien to the barcelona xi that faced napoli on tuesday night

the first is clement lenglet coming in for samuel umtiti in the heart of the defence while the other would see arthur replacing ivan rakitic in midfield

those are two experienced individuals that would be dropping out but given the technical quality that arthur possesses and the partnership that lenglet has built with gerard pique it seems as though it could be a sensible double change from the barcelona coach

meanwhile as reported by as this week pique is expected to be fit to take his place in the starting lineup after suffering a late injury scare against napoli and having to limp off

its suggested that the defensive stalwart didnt even need to undergo tests on his ankle and so there should be no reason as to why hes not available

one other boost could be possible as jordi alba returned to training with the rest of the group on friday for part of the session as per the clubs official site and so he could yet take his place at leftback ahead of junior firpo

in turn its a strong lineup from the reigning la liga champions but theyll need to be on form and ready for the fight at the bernabeu if they wish to come out on top and collect all three points to put themselves in a commanding position in the title race with just 12 games left after this weekend ; king of prussia pennsylvania wpvi  one person was killed during a shootout in the parking lot of an la fitness in upper merion township montgomery county police said

taking care of the body is a top priority for me i think most people dont take this seriously enough its not about health alone  fitness gives one confidence and the ability to cope with stress its not about physical appearance either to me fitness is about being in the best shape you can be in at any age

i lead a disciplined life i work out five days a week in addition to a mix of cardio weightlifting and yoga i enjoy calisthenics because it involves the use of ones own body weight to perform various exercises and it enhances endurance flexibility and strength

i also follow the simple steps  taking the stairs jogging cycling i love football i play whenever i can its just fun and it energises me i also ensure that i get a proper seven to eight hours of sleep a night

i dont starve myself you have to give your body what it needs im a vegetarian but i eat a lot of protein and i have multiple small meals a day

im a foodie and enjoy all kinds of cuisines but i also take care to work off what i eat i dont take too much oil in my food but on the other hand im not too finicky when comes to eating out

i am from punjab and everything there is tadka maar ke so i indulge occasionally but i dont worry about it once in a while its okay to eat something one likes and avoids daily as long as one doesnt make a habit of it

i like spending time with my family thats my biggest stressbuster  playing with my kids going cycling and swimming together

a healthy heart is important to me so it makes me proud that i can work out without getting out of breath or tiring easily

whether its fitness or success there is no alternative to hard work in addition to achieve your dreams you have to be strong and never give up ; it involves exposing yourself to flashfreeze air temperatures the therapy was used widely by sportspersons and celebrities before it went mainstream

christiano ronaldo famously had a chamber installed in his home jennifer aniston daniel craig and jessica alba have sworn by it robin uthappa ranbir kapoor and farhan akhtar use it too

wholebody cryotherapy wbc is popular among elite sportspersons and stars looking for quick recovery and rehabilitation but its now being used more widely to manage pain and chronic inflammation as well as just to feel refreshed awake and alive heres what you should know before you seek some cold comfort

what is it

 you enter a vertical cylindrical chamber almost naked  standing in just your underwear and thick socks and sometimes gloves to protect your sensitive areas and extremities

 a platform inside the machine adjusts your position so your head sticks out at the top

 inside air cooled by liquid nitrogen drops the temperature drop to about 150 c

 you stay in the chamber for 30 seconds to three minutes

 when youre done you exit the chamber and do a few minutes of light stretches to get your blood flowing

ive done it and it feels a little colder than standing in a meat freezer since nothing is in contact with your body its actually more comfortable than being in cold water says gaurav sethi director of alchemy life which offers wbc in mumbai

what could go wrong

 any liquid content will freeze on your skin and cause cold burns so wipe yourself dry before entering a cryotherapy chamber

 us sprinter and olympian justin gaitlin got frostbite on his feet from a cryotherapy mishap caused reportedly by wet socks

 hypothermia could set in if it is managed incorrectly says dr jha you should recognise shivering and slurred speech as the onset of hypothermia and stop the treatment immediately if any skin starts turning blue stop immediately

 dont do it at all if you are pregnant or have a heart condition asthma high or low bp open wounds a fever or cold says patel

how does it feel

the cooling process is gradual says revati krishna an ht correspondent who tried a threeminute session you will feel extremely cold for the time you are in the chamber depending on your bodys natural response to cold you may or may not shiver but theres no uneasiness expect to feel some lingering chill in your lower body for a few minutes after the session ends

past  present

 wbc was developed in the 1970s in japan as a treatment for rheumatoid arthritis

 by the 90s it had become popular across europe with spas offering cryotherapy as an alternative treatment for chronic pain

 as its popularity grew so did unsubstantiated claims of its benefits some athletes use it almost daily to reduce inflammation spas now claim that it helps with psoriasis sleep disorders and migraines weight loss poor skin damaged hair even impaired focus and listlessness while it may help alleviate the symptoms of these conditions for a day or two it is not a treatment for any of them

law enforcement member working out wsaw photo

most law enforcement departments in wisconsin do not have annual programs to measure employee fitness after an officer or deputy is hired according to the wisconsin professional police association

that lines up with what 7 investigates learned from area departments including the marathon county sheriffs office wausau police department oneida county sheriffs office and others one local exception apart from marshfield was the wisconsin rapids police department whose contract includes a clause providing for an annual physical assessment and a requirement to maintain physical fitness as determined by a doctor another type of fitness program around the state include departments such as appleton police that have incentivebased annual fitness programs

stevens point assistant police chief tom zenner told newschannel 7 the department is paying close attention to the marshfield case wausau deputy chief matt barnes also noted they are actively looking at whats in the best interest of the police department with the belief that physical fitness is important

wisconsin not unlike many other states does not set statewide fitness standards for law enforcement the state department of justice through its training  standards bureau has had a fitness test for students entering and exiting their law enforcement academy program since 2016 but the law enforcement standards board  a group of 12 chiefs and sheriffs created by wisconsin law to set certifications and training across the state  leaves it up to individual departments to decide what physical fitness requirements are set for officers they hire once they complete the academy that also applies to any fitness requirements placed on officers and deputies throughout their careers

that doesnt mean wellness of all types including physical isnt encouraged and mcsos sheriff scott parks noted that the physical requirements for their bomb squad are federally regulated the wausau police department has four committees dedicated to officer wellness including one for physical fitness nearly all police chiefs or sheriffs that 7 investigates reached out to noted that wellness if not mandated was still an encouraged priority nationwide a 2016 task force led in part by the international association chiefs of police iacp designated officer safety and wellness as one of the key pillars necessary for driving healthy communitypolice relations

but in regards to establishing annual requirements for officer physical fitness wisconsin law stops short any changes that would allow the doj to set statewide fitness requirements for law enforcement would require change at a legislative level according to doj deputy communications director rebecca ballweg the lesb has discussed that in the past shelly sandry with the dojs training and standards bureau said but its never gone forward

the belief is that chiefs and sheriffs should be able to make their own decisions based on their department sandry said about fitness standards it is encouraged that every agency has a wellness program

beauchamp a longtime mpd patrol officer who during his career had suffered a knee injury failed the physical fitness test by about 30 seconds during the quartermile run he was subsequently terminated prompting the wppa to enter negotiations with the mpd to reinstate him

palmer believes gramza needs to legally demonstrate that the test resulting in beauchamps termination was an appropriate measure of his essential job duties and that it does not include discrimination newschannel 7 has attached both the mpd annual test standards and the mpd job requirements to this article

the absence of annual physical tests resulting in termination helps municipalities avoid liability from having to enforce standards that may affect different people differently palmer said citing people with disabilities women and older employees

we believe he applies a more lenient test for new police officer applicants who would obviously tend to be younger palmer said referring to mpds initial medical clearance for newlyhired officers experienced officers such as jared beauchamp deserve more respect for their many years of service to the community

while gramza declined to comment on this story due to the ongoing nature of the personnel negotiations with the wppa newschannel 7 found a 2019 interview with the marshfield news outlet on focus where gramza discussed the new annual fitness requirements that were built into the contract

not a lot of agencies do this but its also i think very overdue in the profession gramza told on focuss karlie hohl in 2019 we consider this part of their essential job functions in the interview he cited a consultant that had helped develop the test specifically to meet marshfields policing needs

according to palmer negotiations with gramzas attorney are not progressing well and that its likely the case will result in a lawsuit ; if you met deanna baldwin a few years ago the 34yearold los angeles native and former basketball player was a serious meat eater she could wake up in the morning and consume a whole steak for breakfast like it was nothing and would scarf down hot links before a big game assuming all the physical activity would keep her from putting on too much weight but if you get to know her now she wouldnt touch any of that

i dont think that i would ever eat another piece of meat she told me over the phone

baldwin is now vegan and shes never felt better the headaches that used to plague her before have virtually disappeared since she went plantbased and in the last 18 months shes managed to shed about 100 pounds of weight that caught up with her in her late twenties she made the change all because she wanted to fuel her body better and at the same time respect the animals she at one time loved to eat

i am very conscious about the types of foods i put in my body making sure its organic making sure it doesnt contain any animal products and really focusing on mental clarity as well she said i think the first step for me was being mentally ready to change my life and lifestyle

we talked to baldwin about how she was able to make the jump from loving a good hunk of meat to passing it up for a fully plantbased diet how her body has transformed both inside and out and how truly if she could go vegan anybody can

madamenoire in the time that you were playing ball how were you treating your body when it came to food and how would you describe your build

deanna baldwin during college i really wasnt the best eater but you know your metabolism is a lot higher so i did more workouts to compensate for that we worked out seven days a week lots of cardio so it really didnt catch up to me until i hit about late twenties during that time i started powerlifting and i was getting really bulky but it wasnt the healthiest i was also in grad school so i had a lot of stress so that was my way of releasing it

so how did you end up going vegan

what i did was i started valuing the things that i was eating i had a friend and we were talking about changing over to a plantbased diet or vegan diet so i started by cutting out all meats and only ate dairy as far as cheese and egg whites in a month i just went completely vegan

what ushered in that desire to make this change to the way you eat was it just the way your body was feeling before you went plantbased or maybe some new knowledge you obtained about the benefits of a vegan diet

it was a combination of the two i started reading up on a lot of different foods and how it affects your body all the chemicals that theyre putting in foods and also i didnt like the way my body felt i was in shape as far as strength but i wasnt in shape as far as my cardiovascular i could barely run a mile straight or id be winded when going up stairs i would be tired all of the time i really wanted to physically feel my best and prolong my life

how has your body changed since you started eating vegan obviously you said that youve lost 100 pounds in a short amount of time 18 months but what are the other ways you have transformed and how has that inspired the way you train

first off i used to get really bad migraines i havent had a headache or migraine since ive been plantbased and vegan also ive lost a lot of body fat which is great compared to me eating meat i was a carnivore i would eat a piece of steak for breakfast getting my protein from plants compared to meat it is actually taking my workout regimen up a notch i have a lot more energy to really push past my limits in the gym my body fat has gone down ive got more muscle mass and have been able to modify my speed to back when i was like in high school

how do you specifically get your protein now especially as someone who still weightlifts but doesnt eat meat

i eat lots of legumes lots of nuts lots of beans kale spinach broccoli a lot of vegetables contain a lot of protein lets say i would have four grams of chicken  but i would still be hungry i can get twice as much protein if i eat two heavy bowls of salad i love to eat so i get to eat a lot more all day laughs i also eat protein shakes that are based off of hemp powder or pea powder

what is your advice to someone looking into veganism since it is more popular these days but theyre feeling somewhat doubtful that they can do it you at one point were eating steak for breakfast so as a reformed carnivore what would you share with others

the first step is knowing that youre not going to be perfect i know people believe oh they went vegan overnight it takes some time to really learn about your body and about what food you put in and what actually doesnt have any animal byproducts theres so many things that say theyre vegan and theyre not they have a lot of milk solids in them so i would say really focus on watching a documentary that can tell you about veganism from an animal activism perspective youre more respecting animals and living things that have mothers when you look at it that way youre kind of able to separate eating vegetables compared to eating a piece of steak and also for me meat and things started tasting funny thats when i started doing research on what was really being put into the meat doing the research finding out what works for you your body type what types of food combinations you would put together where you would be fulfilled is important

if you wanted to start out with different types of meat substitutes to go with your vegetables so youre not missing it as much and also you get full more off of lettuce and vegetables over a meat and rice meal so eating a lot of vegetables you think you wouldnt get full but youre going to get full and youre just going to be eating a lot more anyone can do it if i can do it and i literally could eat meat all day like three hotlinks before a game anyone can do it the key is to take it one day at a time and know that youre not going to be perfect if you do fall off or mess up you can always get back on the train and keep going ; yoga one day and martial arts on another a swiftr membership allows you easy access through their app and the freedom to choose between hundreds of workout classes at many studios around luxembourg denisa šustalova who manages swiftr in luxembourg tells us more

rtl introduces portuguese fado musician ana moura 0 ; johannesburg  fitness group virgin active south africa has opposed the setting up of a fitness industry regulatory authority for the industry saying any oversight would ultimately affect the consumer

in submission made to the minister of sport art and culture nathi mthethwa regarding the proposed amendments to the sports and recreation act the group which operates 136 health clubs nationwide and serves more than 800 000 members said it is critical that the government considers the full impact of the amendments on the industry as a whole including smaller operators individual fitness professionals the consumer and the taxpayer who could end up carrying the cost of further unneeded government regulation

the fitness industry in south africa already operates within a comprehensive regulatory framework  further oversight adds no value to the industry or the consumer regulation will place an administrative burden on the industry particularly for smaller operators and individual fitness professionals

we foresee increased costs to operators the individuals that operate within the industry and ultimately the consumer who stands to see little benefit from this said mark field managing director virgin active south africa

it said the fitness industry has an important role to play in improving the health of society and reducing the burden on the health care system pointing out that the rising prevalence of lifestyle linked diseases such as obesity diabetes and hypertension can be effectively managed through exercise thereby reducing stress on the healthcare system ; sane was injured during the tie at wembley against liverpool

it was later revealed that he ruptured his anterior cruciate ligament and wasnt expected back to the firstteam until january at the earliest

the club hoped that sane would be back for the latter stages of the champions league but he wasnt able to return for the first leg against real madrid this week

pep guardiola has been given a major fitness boost however as sane looks set to return to action ; life is looking rosier for manchester united since they came back from the winter break

wins against chelsea and watford have put them right back in contention for the top four and manchester citys ban from european competitions for the next two seasons has actually put the red devils in the final champions league qualification spot

they also got past club brugge with ease in the europa league romping to a 50 win in the second leg at old trafford to book their place in the roundof16

it puts them in a healthy position going into their premier league match at everton on sunday

the toffees have improved since carlo ancelotti took charge in december but suffered a defeat in their last outing against arsenal

uniteds last visit to goodison park saw them get slaughtered 40 in april 2019  a poor performance that former red devil gary neville described as rancid

on the positive side the only way is up and man united boss ole gunnar solskjaer will be hoping for a result this time

hell be without the likes of marcus rashford and paul pogba and another injury concern is anthony martial who sat out the win over brugge as he picked up a thigh injury earlier in the week

a scan on friday will give the club an idea about the extent of his injury and whether hell be fit to play on sunday

below you can see how manchester united should line up against everton according to talksportcom

united usually go for a 343 formation for tricky away matches but martials potential absence poses a problem

the frenchman may have three goals in his last three appearances but playing him while carrying an injury wouldnt be a smart move especially given rashford isnt back any time soon

so weve gone for ighalo who against brugge up top and if goals are an issue then martial can always come off the bench

bruno fernandes has reinvigorated united in attack so should obviously start in the no10 role alongside him should be daniel james and juan mata who both played on thursday

scott mctominay marked his return to the firstteam with a goal against brugge but a game at everton could be too intense for a player easing his way back from injury so fred who scored twice should play alongside nemanja matic

david de gea will start in goal and eric baillys return to fitness should see him start alongside captain harry maguire while mainstays at fullback aaron wanbissaka and luke shaw should also get the nod ; the energy required for a bacterium to grow and colonize the host is generated by metabolic and respiratory functions of the cell proton motive force produced by these processes drives cellular mechanisms including redox balance membrane potential motility acid resistance and the import and export of substrates previously disruption of succinate dehydrogenase sdhb and fumarate reductase frda within the oxidative and reductive tricarboxylic acid tca pathways in uropathogenic e coli upec cft073 indicated that the oxidative but not the reductive tca pathway is required for fitness in the urinary tract those findings led to the hypothesis that fuma and fumc encoding fumarase enzymes of the oxidative tca cycle would be required for upec colonization while fumb of the reductive tca pathway would be dispensable however only upec strains lacking fumc had a fitness defect during experimental urinary tract infection uti to further characterize the role of respiration in upec during uti additional mutants disrupting both the oxidative and reductive tca pathways were constructed we found that knockout of frda in the sdhb mutant strain background ameliorated the fitness defect observed in the bladder and kidneys for the sdhb mutant strain and results in a fitness advantage in the bladder during experimental uti the fitness defect was restored in the sdhbfrda double mutant by complementation with frdabcd taken together we demonstrate that it is not the oxidative or reductive pathway that is important for upec fitness per se but rather only the oxidative tca enzyme fumc this fumarase lacks an ironsulfur cluster and is required for upec fitness during uti most likely acting as a counter measure against exogenous stressors especially in the ironlimited bladder niche ; an interesting stock that came up in some of our conversations today is planet fitness inc nyseplnt at current price of 6724 the shares have already lost 483 points 67 lower from its previous close of 7207 should you buy or avoid them the stock sets an active trading volume day with a reported 945573 contracts so far this session plnt shares had a relatively better volume day versus average trading capacity of 9711 thousand shares but with a 8169 million float and a 1814 run over a week its definitely worth keeping an eye on the one year price forecast for plnt stock indicates that the average analyst price target is 8277 per share this means the stock has a potential increase of 231 from where the plnt share price has been trading recently

looking at the current readings for planet fitness inc the twoweek rsi stands at 2165 this figure suggests that plnt stock for now is overbought meaning that the shares are not stable in terms of price movement the stochastic readings on the other hand based on the current plnt readings is similarly very revealing as it has a stochastic reading of 459 at this stage this figure means that plnt share price today is being overbought

technical chart claims that planet fitness inc plnt would settle between 7422share to 7637share level however if the stock price goes below the 7041 mark then the market for planet fitness inc becomes much weaker if that happens the stock price might even plunge as low as 6875 for its downside target the stock is currently in the red zone of macd with the indicator reading 982 traders are always alerted for the move of a stock above or below the zero line due to the fact that the reading is an indicator of the position of the shortterm average relative to the longterm average if the macd is above the zero line then the shortterm average relative is above that of the longterm average thus implying an upward momentum vice versa is the case if the macd is below the zero line

body check tags  ; a new chicago startup wants to give consumers a better way to visit their favorite studios and gyms

mystrongcircle founded by borislava baeva has built an online marketplace for users to find and bundle up to three local studios they want unlimited access to the startup launched this week in chicago with more than 20 local studios offered on its platform including sweat in the gold coast bare feet power yoga in the west loop and title boxing club which has several locations around chicago

baeva who has a background in corporate finance began building mystrongcircle early last year after noticing a gap in the fitness market from first glance mystrongcircle seems similar to new yorkbased classpass a venturebacked fitness marketplace that gives subscribers limited access to dozens of studios in their city

but mystrongcircle differentiates itself by offering unlimited access to a few of consumers most favorite studios as opposed to limited access to several classpass usually limits users to three visits per studio each billing cycle additionally going to a studio regularly rather than a few times per month allows patrons to foster a stronger relationship with the studio and other members baeva said

when i was using classpass i felt like a very transactional user she said you never feel like you belong to the places where youre going you always feel a little bit like an outsider

using mystrongcircle consumers can select up to three studios they wish to visit on an unlimited basis and are guaranteed to pay less than if they purchased unlimited plans to each studio individually baeva said

specific pricing depends on which studios users choose but they can expect to save 60 percent on unlimited memberships baeva said the startup also offers preset bundles which range from 145 to 296 per month

i wanted people to be able to create their own strong circle baeva said and it usually takes more than one thing to make you strong whatever support network that is

data shows that one in every four fitness consumers utilizes more than one club and that within the boutique fitness segment specifically 87 percent exercise in at least two studios according to a report from the international health racquet  sportsclub association

once users select their studios of choice they will be able to view a consolidated schedule of classes available to them from each studio and book classes within the app

right now most of the studios available on mystrongcircle are small boutique studios but baeva said in the future shed like to onboard big fitness chains such as equinox or corepower yoga baeva also wants to scale mystrongcircle and launch the service in other markets later this year

i love the idea of partnering with other studios without the hassle of pricing marketing and executing each individual partnership said liza solberg the owner of spynergy in wicker park one of the studios available on mystrongcircle i am excited to be a mystrongcircle partner because at spynergy we do one thing really well and i appreciate that our clients can be both loyal to us and also seek variety in their weekly routine ; boosie badazz may sound like the name of the 13yearold soundcloud rapper sidekick of the cash me ousside girl who got his nickname after getting supremely plastered on two sips of pink wine at a party but boosie badazz is the current stage name of a 37yearold grown rapper who used to by lil boosie and whose real name is torrence hatch jr well boosie badazz got his badazz kicked out of a planet fitness in georgia because on the solar systems ninth planet known as fitness they do not tolerate transphobic trash talk

as you probably know former nba star dwyane wade has been publicly supportive of his 12yearold child zaya coming out as transgender dwyane was on good morning america earlier this week where he said that zaya has known since she was 3 years old and later after doing her own research she realized that shes trans while zayas mother and dwyanes exwife siohvaughn funches hasnt said anything about her daughters transition dwyane has made it clear that hes supporting and protecting zaya zayas stepmother gabrielle union has also been letting out streams of love over zayas transition but because the internet is the internet some have popped in to give their thoughts on how dwyane wade is raising his child those some includes boosie badazz

boosie spit out a message for dwyane wade about accepting zaya for who she is and the dingles that fell out of his mouth included that is a male a 12yearold he might meet a woman at 16 and fall in love with her but his dick be gone dont cut his dick off bro and dont dress him as a woman and just like that boosie badazz earned a place on jk rowlings spotify playlist of favorite artists im sure that dwyane wade listened to every word because who wouldnt take parenting advice from a mess who got on twitter to call for a bad bitch to give his 14yearold son oral sex as a birthday present

fyi transitional surgery isnt available in the us for anyone under the age of 18

boosie barfed up that wendy williamsapproved transphobic sermon inside of a planet fitness and planet fitness wants no part of it when youre in a planet fitness you need to be working out your body not your mouth by spitting out that nonsense and so when boosie tried to get into a planet fitness the manager told him to take his ass to a galaxy far far away we know this because boosie posted a video saying that the manager who is gay refused to let him in for what he said about dwyane wades daughter and for calling an employee a homophobic slur boosie has been accused of murder so everyone at that planet fitness got off easy with this spoken 0star yelp review

in a statement to people planet fitness confirmed that boosie was kicked out for violating their policy against discrimination

planet fitness does not tolerate harassment or discrimination of any kind in this instance a guest was asked to leave after refusing to comply with gym policies and harassing club staff we are the home of the judgement free zone and as such we have policies in place to ensure that we maintain a nonintimidating welcoming environment for all of our members where everyone feels accepted

boosie is trying to get us to not go to planet fitness but this entire story makes me almost want to go to planet fitness listen i said almost because if i stepped into any gym id see people doing weird things like picking up weights and powerwalking on one of those tv machines with a conveyer belt in front of it and id immediately kick myself out and yes kicking myself out of a gym counts as cardio ; hip hop dance cardio

rabada suffered the injury during the recent t20i series against australia according to a cricket south africa press release he played all three games bowling 11 overs and conceding 114 runs while taking two wickets he is expected to be ruled out for around four weeks

while this is rabadas first significant groin injury he has regularly suffered with back problems throughout his career to date in 2018 he missed the ipl with a stress injury and last year he left the tournament early after a niggle faf du plessis would later bemoan rabadas presence at that tournament during the world cup suggesting his pace was down following his knock

kagiso sustained a groin muscle strain in the t20 series against australia said dr shuaib manjra csas chief medical officer he was assessed by the medical staff assisted by an mri scan

the significant injury means that he will take approximately four weeks to heal which effectively rules him out of both the australia and india odi series the csa medical staff will ensure his effective and expeditious recovery

delhis opening game in this years ipl is at home to kings xi punjab and takes place on monday march 30 according to the suggested timeframe his groin will likely have healed by that time though it is by no means certain that he will have returned to match fitness in time to play last year rabada was the sides leading wickettaker with 25

rabadas replacement has yet to be named south africas threematch odi series against australia begins in paarl on saturday while the series in india starts on march 12 ; like many of us grace barbersbajas ideal body is that of jlos she said so in her instagram post where she posted what she does in her oneonone pilates beginners class

she also confessed that she hasnt been consistent with her workouts this year as shes been travelling a lot

as with anything in life it really takes a lot of time commitment hard work and discipline to get the results you want as theres just no easy way to get there  and for someone like me whos naturally big  big boned and big everything from top to bottom  this also means  i have to put in double the effort  she captioned her post

were all cheering for you grace ; it was never about male or female officers  it was a fight for equal rights and the supreme court has upheld the right to gender equality in the armed forces as enshrined in articles 15 and 16 of the constitution of india in a benchmark judgment on february 17 the supreme court granted parity to women officers with male officers with respect to consideration for permanent commission and opportunity for command of units based on the selection criteria the parity granted is only partial and was restricted to the plea of the litigants as related to terms and conditions of short service commission in the combat support arms excluding artillery and combat support services women are still not at par with their male counterparts with respect to the following rightsopportunities

direct permanent commission into the armed forces through the national defence academy after 102 and respective service academies after graduation joining fighting arms  infantrymechanised infantry and armoured corps  and one combat support arm artillery in the army service on ships and submarines in the navy indian navy has in principle accepted the proposal subject to womenspecific facilities being created joining special forces enrolment as soldiers sailors and airmen ie as personnel below officer rank indian army has made a small beginning with enrolment of 100 soldiers in the corps of military police in december 2019

the battle for absolute and rightful gender parity for women in the armed forces is going to be tough and long drawn the patriarchal military is likely to give no quarter and none should be asked having been born and brought up in the army i have had firsthand experience of this attitude there is no doubt that officers and soldiers respect women literally to a fault but complete with exemplary chivalry this respect is similar to the attitude of condescending gallant knights on white horses rescuing damsels in distress back in 1992 the military had granted short service commission to women officers after government intervention primarily to maintain a veneer of gender equality in the armed forces and no more while the armed forces grudgingly accepted women officers due to their meritorious performance further reforms for gender parity were scuttled based on untenable arguments of relative differences in physiology rigours of military service lack of infrastructure for women in the field and above all the perceived cultural nonacceptance of women commanders by soldiers

if women cant measure up to physical fitness standards of the services then they cant seek gender parity

sample the attitude of the hierarchy general bipin rawat then chief of army staff now chief of defence staff on december 15 2018 in an interview to cnnnews 18 said women in combat would have to be cocooned from the prying eyes of subordinate soldiers commanding officers of fighting units might require long maternity leave which the army can ill afford our soldiers are not ready to accept women leading them and the society is not ready for women coming back in body bags if these are the views of the seniormost military officer of the armed forces one shudders to think about the attitude of the rank and file

the underlying principle of the supreme court judgment is that so long as women meet the desired physical intellectual and performance standards they should have parity with their male colleagues in the armed forces and therein lies the challenge for women to change the entrenched mindset of the military hierarchy and its subordinate officers and soldiers with at par if not better performance in all fields firstly this performance must come in the physical fitness standards an argument often made by detractors of women in the armed forces however both the military and the women officers are to blame for this in the initial stages the induction of women in the armed forces was seen as a cosmetic appendage and very low physical fitness standards  barely 50 per cent of male standards  were laid down this is something women officers should have protested against women remained complacent and thus could not cope up with the physical rigours of soldiering

these standards have since been revised but are still 2530 per cent lower than men with no tests for upper body strength equal rights and opportunities imply equal physical standards the standards have to be rolespecific and not gender or agespecific the military must revise the physical fitness standards for women to make them at least up to the minimum standards laid down for the men for combat arms and special forces these must be at par with the standards laid down for men standards would also have to be laid down for postpregnancy fitness recovery in terms of time coping up with the physical fitness standards to withstand the rigours of military service is the biggest challenge for women as according to the center for military readiness usa on an average they are shorter and smaller than men with 4550 per cent less upper body strength and 2530 per cent less aerobic capacity which is essential for endurance

greek philosopher euripides 480406 bc said 2400 years ago the daughters of sparta are never at home they mingle with young men in wrestling matches physical fitness standards are fundamental women must understand that if they cannot measure up to the physical fitness standards set for various services they have no right to seek gender parity there is no separate battlefield only for amazons

on the issue of gender equality in the armed forces we are decades behind other armies

secondly gender parity also implies no concessions with respect to terms and conditions of service of course physiological genderspecific concessions like maternity leave will be encoded in rules and regulations women officers must set an example by adopting measures similar to those taken by women sportspersons the experience so far has been that the performance of women officers declined post marriage and after bearing children there was a marked tendency to request for peace tenures to take care of children and to be with the spouse the problem was manageable due to the small numbers and short service tenure of 104 years with grant of permanent commission women will have to cope with schoolgoing children and related domestic issues

the problem will become more acute with induction of women as soldiers due to tougher conditions of service women also have to be prepared for 50 per cent of their service tenures to be in field or operational areas away from their families as it is for men facilities in field and operational areas are primitive and rudimentary women will have to bear the same privations as male soldiers

thirdly women will have to accept service in mixed gender units in future with the attendant problems related to privacy and instinctual male conduct this has been a manageable problem so far as women are serving only as officers and dealing with soldiers as superiors once women are enrolled as soldiers the problem will become more acute there is limited scope for womenonly units the armed forces will codify rules and regulations for conduct but as in other armies it will remain a challenge

fourthly with grant of permanent commission women officers will be eligible for courses and competitive examinations as part of military education programme since these are mostly in the intellectual domain women officers must outperform men to prove the point

on the issue of gender equality in the armed forces we are decades behind other armies the supreme court and the high courts have paved the way strictly on the basis of the fundamental right to equality however the women will have to measure up to the strict intellectual and physical standards of the armed forces further reforms to earn absolute gender parity and the rights still denied will be contingent on the performance of the women officers in service particularly those granted permanent commission

how long do u workout for in the gym do u do a hard core workout such as hiit or do u switch it up within the work period ur in there a third fan asked

earlier this week the inquisitr shared that the stunner sizzled in another smoking hot look that time with her dog in tow in the nsfw photo castro flaunted her curvy hourglass figure in a workout ensemble that featured an unzipped bra  which helped her show off a decent amount of cleavage  as well as a pair of leggings in the same color that hugged her lower half that post also racked up a ton of attention for the social media sensation ; navi mumbai with allrounder hardik pandya seamer bhuvneshwar kumar and opener shikhar dhawan  all returning from injuries  turning out for reliance one against bank of baroda in the dy patil t20 tournament on friday morning the bcci asked outgoing chief selector msk prasad to immediately fly to the city and rush to the dy patil stadium to observe the trio

what he saw unfold pleased the former india wicketkeeper whose tenure now looks likely to be extended to picking the indian team for the three odi series against south africa which will begin at dharamshala on march 12 it was good to see hardik and bhuvi steaming in to bowl all three look to be in good shape and im happy about that prasad said

having suffered a lower injury which has seen him out of action since a t20 international against south africa on september 22 in bangalore pandya who underwent a successful surgery in london didnt do too badly in his first outing on a cricket field after almost five months walking in at no 4 in the seventh over the 26yearold smashed four sixes in a 25ball cameo of 38 and then took three for 26 in 34 overs  the second one with a vicious bouncer he ran swiftly between the wickets and looked quick with the ball thanks to his allround effort reliance 1 beat bob by 25 runs

apart from prasad india a and under19 coach paras mhambrey national cricket academy nca physio ashish kaushik and the entire mumbai indians support staff  pravin amre kiran more zaheer khan robin singh and ta sekar  was also closely monitoring pandyas fitness level in his first game after back surgery with ipl13 set to begin on march 29 pandyas return to fitness spells big relief to the mi camp too

other than pandya dhawan who had sustained a shoulder injury during the series against australia and bhuvneshwar who underwent a surgery for sports hernia also did enough to prove that they were now fit to return to international cricket and play in the ipl that follows after that dhawan made just 14 but the way he smashed a six and a four in his short stint in the middle showed that his shoulder was now back in top shape

bhuvneshwar bowled three overs for 14 runs without taking a wicket ; fast growing fitness chain plans to open in downtown dubai silicon oasis abu dhabi and sharjah during 2020

gymnation has opened two new branches in the uae to reinforce its position as countrys fastest growing fitness brand

following the openings of its bur dubai and ras al khaimah branches the fitness chain also announced plans to open in downtown dubai silicon oasis abu dhabi and sharjah during 2020

the homegrown fitness concept said it opened its doors in january to over 3000 members in ras al khaimah manar mall and 4000 members at its bur dubai branch

gymnation said it now has close to 20000 members

gymnation launched its frillfree affordable fitness concept a little over a year back and within the first 12 months grew a membership base in excess of 10000 at its flagship facility in al quoz dubai

it said it is targeting over 50000 members across all gyms by the end of 2020 to make gymnation the largest fitness chain across the uae

loren holland founder said when we first set up gymnation the uae gym market had become rather stagnant it was incredibly expensive actually the second most expensive in the world according to a deutsche bank study and so we saw a real opportunity to develop a value driven lowcost gym brand that caters to what people really need

our new locations all follow the same unique proposition which includes our signature aed99 per month prelaunch offer and whilst we still cut out the frills we ensure our facilities are world class open 247 and have one of the most vibrant atmospheres you will find anywhere in the city

frank afeaki founder gymnation added our 2020 expansion plans are extremely exciting and we are delighted with the success of the ras al khaimah and bur dubai openings ; i spent the night in a standard room with a balcony and loved the views and vintageinspired decor but found the accommodations to be noisy this hotel is best for groups of friends and families rather than couples seeking a luxurious romantic getaway

ever reminisce about that funky beach house you rented with friends that one great summer staying at kimpton surfcomber hotel is kind of like that

the 186room beachfront hotel from ihg is more laidback than many higherend south beach hotels while still offering full resort amenities and all the great perks kimpton hotels are known for like daily happy hour fitness classes bike rentals and other social gatherings

the decor is bright bold and eclectic with beachy rooms spread between two buildings that lead out to a central courtyard and pool all at budgetfriendly rates

its the kind of place groups of friends come for a girls getaway bachelor or bachelorette gathering or couples weekend i spotted a few families during my onenight stay but the crowd felt predominantly under 40

as such the vibe is a bit like a relaxed house party though its never overly raucous this is somewhere to stay when you want to feel the buzz of south beach but without the inyourface pulse of the club scene or inflated prices of luxury fivestar hotels down the street

i spent the night in an oceanfront king premier room with balcony comped for review purposes but starts around 230 per night in low season and rises to 350 at busier times the cheapest standard king deluxe room faces the city or interior and starts at 150 in low summer season or about 200 in peak season

however you should know its not the quietest hotel even if you stay away from collins avenue housed in is a historic art deco gem the buildings age gives way to noise bleed that i observed often even in a midtier room

so if youre looking for a quiet intimate retreat this is not the best fit but for kimpton fans and those wanting a fun lively and affordable stay its a solid south beach option

located on vibrant collins avenue the demure kimpton surfcomber is flanked by south beach behemoths like the sls the ritz carlton and the delano yet the hotel still made a striking first impression with preserved art deco exteriors covered in parts in rich green ivy

inside the spacious lobby the seating was cleverly designed with statement green walls and curated furnishings with bold fabrics and textiles vintage decor books and antiques served as unique accents and the open space flowed easily to the adjacent social club restaurant

i arrived on a thursday around lunchtime and there was no line ahead of me to checkin the process was quick and easy and the agent checking me in informed me of the many fun perks kimpton hotels offer here that included a free happy hour daily fitness classes and social gatherings around the pool as well as bike rentals of course its not truly free many of those perks are part of the hotels daily 34 plus tax resort fee

i was booked in an oceanfront king premier room with balcony comped for review purposes but starts around 230 per night in low season and rises to 350 at busier times its quite affordable for 480 square feet plus an extra 100 square feet of outdoor balcony space its the toptier standard room before suites which include separate living room areas

i found the room to be beachy and fun with bold headboard and carpeting statement chairs and wellsized for two people there was a very large closet upon entry that could be closed by a curtain and had a robe hanging as well as a yoga mat for inroom use a staple of staying at a kimpton property

beachy details accented the room like the lamp fashioned out of driftwood on the desk colorful chairs and slat blinds that reminded me of beach houses ive stayed at in the past

some details showed wear and age like a metal chain on the door light staining on a lampshade and worn areas of carpeting but none of these matters were major detractors overall the room was clean and comfortable

a long midcentury modern wardrobe added vintage appeal and was topped with an honor bar of snacks sunscreen and drinks which is kimptons version of a minibar a flatscreen tv was mounted above and while it has some smart capabilities it did not offer app streaming from netflix and many channels were fuzzy and out of focus

the bathroom was very small and it is not possible for two people to use the space at once

the walkin tiled shower was stylish but lacking a full glass door only a partition it was stocked with atelier bloem products made exclusively for kimpton by malingoetz and i loved the citrusscented soap and body lotion made from fig theyre all supplied in large refillable ecofriendly bottles and if you want to take it home you can purchase from the front desk for 36 each

i also appreciated a note in the bathroom that offered to supply or lend any forgotten items ranging from deodorant or razors to static spray and phone chargers

my favorite part of the room was the pretty balcony overlooking the pool scene with the ocean in the distance it was far more spacious than the average terrace with two sunbeds and bright yellow rocking chairs its a great option if the pool area gets too crowded or you want to retreat to the room but not give up the sun entirely

the only odd part was the lack of privacy windows from the room next door looked directly onto my balcony and its easy to make eye contact if someone is passing by and the shades arent closed its something to keep in mind if youre opting for a balcony as an intimate romantic extra

in all i thought the room was quirky wellsized and comfortable but noisy i was on the second floor at the end of the hall so i did not hear noise from next door but there was a lot of noise from outside during the day and the sounds of doors slamming were especially loud and woke me up early

i also observed heavy footsteps from above and the constant creaking of the nearby stairwell door opening and closing next to my room i can only imagine that had i been surrounded by more rooms on each side or faced collins it would be even noisier

should i return to this hotel i would book a top thirdfloor room even if it meant sacrificing the balcony light sleepers should come prepared with earplugs or consider another option if thats a dealbreaker however for most the noise is intermittent enough and quiet late at night

as mentioned kimpton surfcomber charges a 34 plus tax resort fee that grants access to the hotels daylife slate of fitness classes social activities lawn games and familyfriendly options

it also provides the popular daily social hour in the lobby with free wine and snacks which attracted many guests during my stay

additionally the fee includes two beach lounge chairs and towels per room plus pool towels and sunscreen boogie boards and a kids area on the beach business services such as printing and faxing free morning coffee and tea newspapers wifi and local and domestic longdistance calls

the pool deck is lined with sunbeds and there are additional chairs off to the side of the lawn area if the pool fills up its a nice touch that the hotel offers fun floaties and pool toys for guests use and the inflatable unicorn seemed to be in constant use

cabanas are also available to rent should you want a private shaded area dedicated chairs and vip waiter service it comes with a minifridge flatscreen tv glass of champagne and fruit platter prices vary depending on the cabana choice and availability

theres also a spa cabana where the hotel provides spa services or they can be arranged in the comfort of your room its a cozy spot and can even be offered openair at night for a twilight massage but prices start at 150 and rise from there which seemed a bit expensive for such a diminutive spa

the gym was closed for renovation during my stay but guests were offered access at the nearby loews hotel exhale gym which is a topoftheline facility

the hotel directly faces the beach and a lush walking path which you can cross to access the hotels dedicated stretch of sand beach chairs and towels are provided as part of the daily resort fee and umbrella rentals and activities like waverunners banana boat kayak paddle boards and parasailing are available at an added cost

high tide bar is a casual stand serving poolside food and drinks from 11 am to 5 pm with items like burgers tacos sandwiches and beachy drinks eat at one of the umbrellacovered tables or order straight to your sun lounger keep an eye out for daily deals too as part of daylife promotions

social club is the hotels main restaurant serving breakfast lunch and dinner with comfort foodinspired small plates such as brisket quesadillas lobster mac and cheese and fried chicken in the evenings a dj spins tunes and the bar area comes to life drawing both hotel guests and outside visitors to the lively scene like the rest of the hotel the look is funky and whimsical with statement chairs and couches along long tables that seem to be a nod back to the hotels social theme that encourages mingling

finally like all kimptons the surfcomber is extremely petfriendly all animals are welcome no matter the size weight or breed at no extra charge with no limits on the number of pets in a room

the hotel loves to pamper and welcomes each pet by name invites them to happy hour and offers perks like plush petbed loaners in your guest room food water bowls and mats as well as a list of nearby petfriendly restaurants parks groomers and pet boutiques door hangers alert other hotel guests and staff that an animal is in the room and courtesy bags are also provided for walking your dog

kimpton surfcomber hotel is located in the heart of south beach facing the beach and a lovely waterfront walking path accessible by a gate next to the pool

in front the hotel faces collins avenue a bustling street filled with vintage tourist storefronts with neon signs selling miamibranded knickknacks and paraphernalia

most area restaurants are found within other hotels and some standouts include lure fishbar at loews miami beach hotel quality meats at the bancroft hotel byblos greek at the royal palms south beach or katsuya next door at the sls south beach

a short walk away is the time out miami market a popular food hall with many popular miami vendors offering a taste of their wellknown dishes

kimpton surfcomber hotel is a toprated property in miami ranking 29 of 221 hotels in miami beach with a rating of 45 out of 5 on trip advisor

past guests rave about the friendly staff daylife fitness offerings the walkable beachfront location and the fun pool scene writes one review the property was very clean from the pool restrooms and all the grounds beautiful pool with both sun and shade an area with grass and games and a great outdoor bar for both lunch and drinks easy walk to the beach for chairs all the staff were friendly and helpful and went out of their way to make sure our trip was enjoyable great activities happy hours and bike riding

complaints tend to relate to noise and outdated rooms similar to my experience one review says whilst the location of the hotel is good this fell far short of expectations and provided poor value for money the resort areas for which one pays a fee on both the beach and the around the pool were claustrophobic on the beach 22 allowed rental of an antiquated small umbrella  the internet did not work on the beach and only by the pool if close to the main hotel  the rooms are tired with waferthin walls and very noisy air conditioning units and was noisy outside

who stays here budgetminded travelers looking for a fun eclectic and beachy scene the party vibe is palpable and seems to attract groups of friends bachelor or bachelorette parties and some families with older kids who appreciate all the perks and activities

we like the relaxed atmosphere and bright decor which add personality and whimsy to this boutique hotel

we love dont miss this feature all the signature kimpton amenities the resort fee is standard in miami and here it actually offers a lot of value take advantage of fitness and wellness offerings or the opportunity to mingle over free drinks and happy hour deals

we think you should know as noted this hotel can be quite noisy its not a quiet peaceful retreat

wed do this differently next time id book a top floor room to help mitigate noise but i would stay at the end of the hall again as i think its best to share as few walls as possible if you seek a quiet stay

the kimpton surfcomber hotel is a budgetfriendly fun and quirky hotel that groups of friends and families will love for the beachy feel relaxed partyfriendly vibe and varied slate of amenities programmings and perks that make for a fun vacation at an affordable price this is a hotel where mingling and socializing are encouraged and everything from activities to common spaces are meant to foster this friendly environment

its not the quietest hotel nor is it a luxury offering but if you simply seek a wellappointed boutique stay with inclusions that add value from a trusted brand like kimpton the surfcomber is a great option that wont cost a fortune either ; george flooks chief executive officer of fitness first middle east

a post shared by lisa  workout videos  lisafiitt on feb 28 2020 at 1035am pst ; the 75yearold is preparing for a gruelling schedule which begins in las vegas next week

penny lancaster says husband sir rod stewart is back to full fitness after his knee replacement op last month

rod 75 has returned to the stage and is preparing for a gruelling schedule which begins in las vegas next week

loose women star penny said hes just done two private shows in florida and he said my knee is better now than it has ever been

he said he was running sideways and it has all been sorted

he is like a masterclass of knee replacement  theres no stopping him

the 48yearold added he is like 75 and he has three weeks in vegas

he then has a twomonth tour in america and then we are off to australia for september and october ; only about 20 of americans get the recommended amount of exercise a week according to the centers for disease control but researchers say theres a tool on the market that has the potential to change that

according to industry experts 2019 was the biggest year yet for virtual reality headset sales and many of the virtual reality games require players to exert an amount of physical energy

when 28yearold martin calugay straps on his virtual reality headset his living room becomes his personal boxing gym

he says between a new baby and a fulltime job as a finance client service specialist its been a struggle to exercise and since hed always liked video games he says he got a vr headset for christmas

ive actually lost four pounds since i got this headset said calugay

the team at the virtual reality institute of health and exercise at san francisco state university has heard countless stories like calugays

the institute was formed three years ago within the schools kinesiology department to calculate the kind of workouts vr games can provide to users

we basically look at how virtual reality gaming can be a form of exercise said principal investigator and assistant professor of kinesiology dr jimmy bagley

they use a variety of scientific equipment to calculate how many calories a player burns while playing any of the dozens of games on the market

we want a really accurate measure so we actually measure the oxygen you breathe in and the oxygen you breath out so without getting technical we look at the calories youre burning during gameplay and compare that to walking jogging or tennis or whatever bagley said

this is done while the player is immersed in a virtual game where he or she doesnt have time to think about your form or calorie burn

instead the player is focused on surviving or dominating in the game whether its by destroying objects coming at him or her or dodging blows from a virtual reality character in a boxing game

the team has created vr exercise ratings found here

this is a game but at the same time its also an intense exercise we hope that people go into thinking its a game but as a consequence get exercise out of it said project coordinator trenton stewart

the vr fitness trend is resonating with entrepreneurs and consumers

black box vr claims to be the worlds first fullfitness virtual reality gym experience with locations in california and idaho

an austin high school teacher shared video with nbc 5 of his students using virtual reality in their pe class

all of it is launching the san francisco research team into future projects

now we want to see if people stick with it whether theyll do it at home or at the gym we want to look at older adults kids people with disabilities the sky is the limit with this kind of research said dr bagley

he notes a couple of downsides it may cause motion sickness at first and the price of a headset can cost 100 to 1000 ; former india pacer balwinder singh sandhu aby kuruvilla and a couple of senior officials from the national cricket academy were also in attendance

the midfielder has been out since boxing day with a knee injury but could be back in the fold at old trafford on the weekend

boss ole gunnar solskjaer said i think he might be in the squad im not surprised hes got back so quickly because thats the type he is

hes a physical specimen hes a leader he never shirks a tackle and he brings everyone with him he can sit with nemanja matic or fred or he can be one of the runners in midfield

were talking about that today that we dont have that many runs past the striker he used to be a striker before so hes used to being in the box

meanwhile solskjaer believes anthony martials hunger to improve will make the frenchman a 20goal striker this season

life started with a bang following his bigmoney move from monaco to manchester in 2015 but the 24yearold frustrated after that breakthrough campaign due to his inconsistent performances

former united boss jose mourinho had been keen to sell martial but successor ole gunnar solskjaer put his faith in a forward that is contracted until 2024 with the option of a further year

that deal looks smart business 13 months on with the striker taking his tally for the season to 14 goals with a fine leveller in thursdays 11 draw at club brugge in the first leg of the europa league round of 32 encounter

solskjaer knows a thing or two about scoring for united and backed the striker to comfortably surpass his previous season best of 17 registered in 201516

i think anthony can step up get a few more and get to the 20 mark yeah definitely the united boss said having referenced injured 19goal forward marcus rashford

hes got quality of course hes a very good finisher he takes his chances really well good technique in his finishing

hes good receiving the ball at times and dropping off he can play almost like a false nine at times as well sometimes id like him to be stronger physically ; a controversial plan to turn the former frontier communications building at 3 high ridge park in stamford into a life time fitness center is gathering momentum again following a state superior court judges ruling

judge marshall berger ruled in favor of developer and property owner george comfort  sons in its appeal of the citys board of representatives decision to accept a petition by area homeowners protesting the project

berger ruled that not enough representative signatures were gathered for that petition which sought to reverse a zoning board change allowing projects like the life time proposal permitting the conversion of mostly vacant corporate parks in residential neighborhoods into other businesses

residents near the site have long maintained that increased traffic and noise would have a negative impact on their lives  issues that george comfort  sons and life time have said have been addressed

those parties maintain that their proposed 100000squarefoot facility essentially would have the same footprint as the building does now and that noisemitigating landscaping would minimize the sound

the board of representatives will decide whether to appeal the judges decision at a march 9 meeting george comfort  sons doing business as high ridge real estate owner issued a statement saying it will proceed with its plans to build the life time fitness center

the building has been vacant since frontier moved to 401 merritt 7 in norwalk in 2015 ; as a part of solcana fitness new referafriend initiative for every referral who signs a 6 or 12month contract solcana will donate 50 to avenues for youth a hennepin countybased social impact organization that empowers youth ages 1624 to find their path out of homelessness solcana will also donate an additional 5 to avenue for youth every time a prospective member tries a free trial class which takes place saturdays and sundays at 11 am ; the unmarried women were questioned if they had ever got pregnant some of the victims even claimed that the medics behaved in a rude manner

on thursday nearly a week after the bhuj incident where 68 girl students were forced to remove their undergarments to prove they were not menstruating a second shocking incident has come to light from a staterun hospital in surat where nearly 100 women trainee clerks of the surat municipal corporation smc were made to stand without clothes for a prolonged duration while the medics conducted the gynaecological finger test

reportedly the affected women arrived at the surat municipal institute of medical education and research for a mandatory fitness test

in a rude shock to the women trainees they were compelled to stand naked in groups of 10 members in a room where their privacy was outrageously breached even the door of the room was not shut properly and the only thing that prevented the inside view was a curtain

according to the times of india the doctors apart from performing the controversial finger test allegedly asked personal questions to the women trainee clerks

the unmarried women were questioned if they had ever got pregnant some of the victims even claimed that the medics behaved in a rude manner

a few woman trainees approached the smc employees union smceu after they were subject to the traumatic finger test

smceu has lodged a complaint with the municipal commissioners general secretary of the employees union aa shaikh demanded the authorities to ban such inhuman and insulting medical tests while speaking to the times of india shaikh lashed out at the doctors and said that if they doubted employees health then they should have examined them in an acceptable way

however ashwin vachhani smimers gynaecology departments head claimed that it is mandatory for them to conduct a physical examination on the women as per the guidelines she asserted that she does not know if such tests are conducted on men but for females there are rules to figure out specific illness and therefore physical examination is done ; on many occasions students and professionals may have confusion with the scope and role of health fitness professionals ie personal trainers and group exercise instructors and clinical exercise physiologists in addition it is not always an easy decision to determine which certification is the best option for a persons career goals this column aims to give a general overview of the differences in the professional scope and role of the health fitness professional and clinical exercise physiologist to highlight available certifications for each profession through acsm and to provide an update on salary and job forecasts 

in addition to education general certification demonstrates that a person has met the minimum competencies for entrylevel employment as determined by acsms job task analysis for each certification  although some of the certifications require a high school diploma as a minimum qualification each candidate should consider formal educational training and the completion of a certificate andor minimum of an associates degree depending on the career goal the timing to complete a certification may assist with enhanced workinternship opportunities for example an individual studying to become a clinical exercise physiologist may benefit from taking a health fitness certification that will result in employment ahead of graduation or greater handson opportunities at an internship that can provide experience with managing clients each section below will go into detail regarding the different roles of each professional and the appropriate acsm certification within each role

following the novel coronavirus outbreak chinese people across the country are advised to comply with home quarantine measures and avoid public events and social gatherings young people in china including wang have found a way to work out through video games

wang said that he now preferred to stay home and keep fit rather than go to coffee shops with his friends on weekends as usual and he had ordered new portable game consoles online

however the manufacturing and transportation of switches and ringcons have been affected by the outbreak the unit price of ringcons has more than doubled to nearly 2000 yuan about us285 recently as most online merchants are out of stock in china

it seems that a century has passed and my switch and ringcon are still on the way wang said

he now wants people at large to put a premium on fitness and wellness

by ushering in the new age sports and medical care hitherto unseen in india the countrys lone individual olympic gold medallist is helping improve the lives of people outside the sporting arena

it is very similar to what daivam really does like lifestyle  going to the route cause of the problem the philosophy is same

it is really the need of the hour what the people in the country need is meeting of minds between similar philosophy for betterment and well being of people

he is trying to ensure the best global practices in either prevention of injuries or treatment of injuries are accessible to the people at large

sport is always the inspiration behind what we do we do a lot of work on prevention of injuries lifestyle related issues which has resulted in a lot of structural imbalances and the technology that we have allows us to make everything much more accountable and completely data driven said bindra

abtp has five centres  in pune new delhi mohali bengaluru and bhubaneswar

with technology we are able to employ assessment protocol which then allows us to evaluate what the imbalances are and then a customised programme is made he said

from back ache to rehabilitation athletes and people at large go to these centres

bindra says wellness is also absolutely important for sportspersons

an athlete is also a human being once we take care of wellbeing of an athlete then performance will automatically come an athlete is not a robot not a machine wellbeing of athletes is absolute necessary

his real goal also is to go to the grassroots identify talent and provide them scientific training and rehabilitation facilities something he feels can help make a big impact in our performance

newell was a late withdrawal from the side to play livingston at the weekend with the midfielder succumbing to an ankle injury just minutes before kickoff

the midfielder who was replaced in the starting lineup by lewis stevenson has been on top form for the easter road side but picked up a knock in the previous weeks victory over kilmarnock

after being forced to sit out saturdays 11 draw with livi newell will be assessed by the clubs medical staff ahead of the clash with caley thistle

manager jack ross said joe suffered the injury at rugby park and only trained in the latter part of last week but had no reaction and felt good

naturally we didnt want to change the team because it has been performing well

but he felt a recurrence of it in the warmup and at that stage its better to make the change pregame than it is in the early part of the game beacuse then you would use up one of your subs

its not a major problem its just frustrating for him and for us that it flared up so late

i dont think it will be something that will rule him out for a significant period of time but its obviously a quick turnaround to friday again

so well assess him as the week goes on

meanwhile with the scottish fa awaiting the referees report murray is expected to be banned for the visit of the highlanders following his sending off in the reserves

the 20yearold was dismissed for serious foul play for a challenge on barry coffey in the 89th minute of hibs 41 defeat to celtic in their spfl reserve cup semifinal

despite the incident coming in a secondstring outing the first match of the youngsters twogame suspension will apply to his next firstteam game ruling him out of friday nights tie

murray has been introduced as a secondhalf substitute in three of the last four matches and his absence will restrict the capital sides attacking options

meanwhile ross is to discuss the issue of his teams penalty takers this week after scott allans miss at the weekend

allan saw his effort saved by robby mccrorie midway through the firsthalf whilst marc mcnulty also failed to score from the spot against ross county almost a fortnight ago

ross said they have both missed so we will reflect on it have a wee chat during the week and see where that takes us going forward

hopefully we score the next one because when you get that opportunity you think by and large you are going to go ahead in the game ; tampa fla wfla  runners joggers and walkers get ready for the 8 on your side health  fitness expo

swedish researchers report that very fit longdistance skiers were about 30 less likely to develop parkinsons disease during their 20year study

the research suggests that any activity that keeps you fit might buffer the brain against disease

our study highlights the importance of staying physically active throughout life in order to have a reserve to better cope when the frailties and diseases of old age inevitably arrive said study senior author tomas deierborg hes an associate professor in neuroscience at lund university in sweden

deierborg said the researchers believe these very fit athletes have built up a greater motor reserve that slows any brain damage from parkinsons disease he said its similar to the idea of cognitive reserve in people with dementia that suggests someone who is welleducated can sustain more brain damage from dementia before symptoms of the disorder become obvious

however not everyone is convinced that motor reserve is playing a role in this studys findings

dr michael okun national medical director for the parkinsons foundation said theres definite agreement among experts that exercise has positive effects on parkinsons disease and many positive effects beyond parkinsons disease but its wishful thinking for us to assume that longdistance skiers have some sort of motor reserve theres just not a lot of data yet

parkinsons disease is a neurodegenerative disorder that often develops slowly over years the exact cause is still unknown according to the parkinsons foundation

the disease may progress differently from one person to the next symptoms often include tremors often at rest other symptoms include slow movements rigid limbs and gait problems

the study followed the health of nearly 200000 longdistance skiers for more than two decades and compared them to a control group from the general population in sweden

the skiers were an average of 36 years old slightly less than twothirds were male all had participated in the vasaloppet long distance crosscountry ski race the race is 90 kilometers about 56 miles long

deierborg said the skiers are very fit as they just participated in one of the longest crosscountry ski races in the world he said most of them skied for at least four hours a week and in general they had higher leisuretime physical activity than the average person in the swedish population they also tended to have better diets

in addition the rate of smoking was far less in the skiers only about 1 smoked compared to around 15 of the general population deierborg noted

compared to the general population the vasaloppet skiers appeared to have a 29 lower risk of developing parkinsons disease over 15 years of followup however the difference in parkinsons cases weakened

deierborg said he doesnt think these benefits are limited to these welltrained skiers any kind of activity would likely reduce the risk of parkinsons he said

on that point okun agreed exercise is good for parkinsons disease you dont need to be an olympiclevel athlete

okun said people with parkinsons disease should participate in a level of activity that works for them ; when lismores union fitness co decided to get behind the red cross bushfire appeal they decided to hold an event which would benefit everyone involved

httpswwwgoodmorningamericacomwellnessvideoterminallyillmangiftsdallasschoolfitnesscenter69111428 ; england staff will request marcus rashfords medical reports amid growing concerns that the manchester united forward could be ruled out of euro 2020

rashford has become a key part of manager gareth southgates plans and would be a prime contender to be a regular during the tournament this summer although jadon sancho has put major pressure on the attackers starting role due to his redhot form at borussia dortmund

ole gunnar solskjaer cast significant doubt on rashfords availability for the euros on wednesday claiming that the players recovery from a double stress fracture of the back was taking longer to heal than expected

england medics have held talks with united and will continue to receive updates so that southgate is kept fully informed of developments as he plans his final squad for the tournament

southgate is desperate for rashford 22 to prove his fitness for the tournament  and rashford is generally happy with the way his recovery is going and believes he can do so

the united youngsters strike partnership with england captain harry kane  also recovering from a longterm hamstring injury  and raheem sterling is one of the most feared in international football

but the emergence of sancho 19 means the england boss has a readymade replacement for rashford should the united star miss out

sanchos form in germany has impressed southgate and his staff in recent weeks and he was already pushing rashford hard in the race to start englands tournament opener against croatia on june 16 ; fuzzy faruque of studio x is a spin instructor at the gym and an avid user of social media as she prepares to start the next chapter of her life she talks to us about her personal journey to fitness how she became a spin instructor and the things she loves to do when shes not working from the delicious things she likes to indulge in on cheat day to her fitness mantra and future plans for studio x she shares it all

how would you describe your fitness philosophy

recently my fitness philosophy has changed i find it an extremely personal journey a journey that one has to make with yourself and that starts with respecting your body and being patient with the process each of us have different genetics and goals so how can one philosophy be for everyone

what inspired you to join the fitness industry

my journey into the fitness industry was purely by default my mother had the gym throughout my childhood yet i never stepped foot in the studio or had any intentions to a couple of years ago my grandfather fell ill and i quit my teaching job to spend more time with him i also had spare time during the day and in order to keep myself busy i started to help my mother with the social media and marketing at the studio from there i spent more time in the classes taking pictures and eventually joined the classes the more classes i took the more i wanted to learn about the health and fitness industry soon enough i told my mother i wanted to become a fitness trainer and her jaw dropped

three things in your diet you cant go a day without

protein shake protein pancakes and dark chocolate

a piece of advice youd give to someone who wants to venture into spinning

well these days since im getting married im not working anymore i cant tell you how much i miss teaching my classes but if we were to talk about what my day comprised of before all the wedding madness then this would be roughly my daily routine my day starts at 9am i take my breakfast to the studio with me where i manage the juice bar and studio in the morning my classes start at 10am after which i do personal training till 1pm i go home for lunch and prep for my evening classes and then go train myself with my personal trainer pervaiz five times a week when im back at the studio i do a run through of the studio and juice bar making sure everything is fine meet clients and then start my evening classes from 68pm by the time i get done im so physically exhausted i literally fall on my sofa and all i want to do is eat my dinner and watch tv in peace and quiet

ah good question when i attended my first spin class i felt that instant connection with the trainer the music and the workout i loved the energy and the mind and body connection it created it only took one class for me to know what i really wanted to speaclise in

advice youd give to people looking to attain a healthier lifestyle

make small goals make small changes be cosistent put in the hard work and dont fall for any fad diets and most importantly move more we dont move enough here

what are some common fitness misconceptionsquestions you are asked by your clients

even though the fitness and health industry has evolved in the last couple of years i still get the same questions i got when i first started these include things like do carbs make you fat and does spin make your legs bulky and so on

how is your fitness mantra different from others

i dont preach i dont upload workout videos i dont tell people what to eat because the journey as i mentioned above is very personal to me and if we dont go through that journey on our own we will never be able to get to know our body and how to respect it what works for it what doesnt i can guide you but the decisons are made purely by the person so that they are able to build the confidence to make their own decisions without second guessing yourself

something you enjoy doing when youre not working

to maintain our service and get clients to stay with uscome back to us when that happens you know youre doing something right

a saying or quote that keeps you going

i dont really have one but as cliche as it sounds enjoy the process be patient and the results will come its true ; key point the military needs to ensure its men and women are fit here is what it would take to successfully pass the new combat fitness test

by october 2020 all soldiers will be required to take and pass the armys new gender and ageneutral combat fitness test which has more events and less time for rest than the services current pt test officials said on mondaythe army has not yet decided what the standards will be that soldiers have to meet on each of the tests six events or whether soldiers will take alternative tests if they fail any or all of the events said sergeant major of the army daniel dailey

we dont need to rush into this  and were not going to dailey said the chief of staff and the secretary have been very adamant about the fact that were going to take a year to study this inside of our organizations

the new test will involve six events that will be completed in 50 minutes or less said maj gen malcolm frost head of the army center for initial military training the current physical fitness test has three events

soldiers will start with a strength deadlift which they will have to complete three times frost said at a media roundtable then soldiers will throw a medicine ball as far as they can over their head

next soldiers will have to do a set of pushups during which they lift their hands off the ground after completing each pushup he said

the fourth event is a 250meter sprintdragcarry in which soldiers must complete five tasks for 50 meters sprint drag a 90pound sled backwards run laterally carry two 45pound kettle bells and sprint again he said

then soldiers will hang perpendicular to a pullup bar and bring their knees or thighs up to their elbows frost said the final event is the 2mile run

the test involves about 37 minutes of work and 13 minutes of rest frost said soldiers get a twominute rest after the first five events and a fiveminute break before the 2mile run the current physical fitness test gives soldiers about 20 minutes of rest for between 15 and 20 minutes of work

this article by jeff schogol originally appeared at task  purpose follow task  purpose on twitter this article first appeared in 2018

the army will put the new combat readiness test through a trial period before the service adopts it as the new pt test of record frost said

starting in october 60 battalions across the army will spend a year training for and taking the combat fitness test providing data that will help the army develop standards for each of the test based on a soldiers unit and military occupational specialty he said

occupational standards that have a higher physical demand are going to be looked at with more scrutiny as to a higher standard because thats what your occupation as a soldier demands for you in combat frost said

us army combat fitness test  official overview by adam weinstein on scribd

all soldiers will begin training for the combat fitness test starting in october 2019 after which the army secretary and chief of staff have up to a year to determine when it will replace the current physical fitness test he said

both frost and dailey have taken the test and they found areas where they needed to improve frost said he needed to work most on the backwards 90pound sled drag

i didnt do as well on the deadlift because i dont do it  i just dont do deadlifts dailey said now i have to train for it just like every other soldier in the army is going to have to do those things

lawyers in the court who stayed away from work on 20 february to protest the transfer have proffered a number of reasons for their anger but chief among them is nearunanimous admiration for the judges work

even those who justice muralidhar has ruled against speak in favour of him

take the case of sanjiv dey a lawyer in his midthirties who lost a service matter for his client that was placed before justice muralidhar

my client is filing a review but i personally feel the reasoning was correct for the judge to rule against us dey said there was not an iota of doubt regarding an incorrect perusal of facts the delhi high court will lose one of its gems and we hope he is transferred back like an earlier judge

another reason for widespread discontent among the members of the bar some say is the delhi hc judges humbleness

advocate sanjoy ghose another delhibased lawyer said the judge was oneofakind who took extra measures to rid the bench of colonialera practices

justice muralidhar was the only judge who refused to be ushered inside the courtroom by a guard who pulled the chair he did that himself ghose said

he had also requested the registry to request lawyers to refrain from calling him lordship once i met him and asked that some lawyers often use the reference as a usual part of addressing a judge to this justice muralidhar said that it was only a request and not a command

also read dear supreme court indians mostly clueless about what goes behind the scene in judiciary

the judge has a reputation of delivering some crucial judgments

in delhi bar associations muralidhar is often referred to as the judge who delivered bold verdicts

the judge was part of the delhi high court bench that had first decriminalised homosexuality in the 2009 naz foundation case

but 2018 was the year when justice muralidhar delivered most of the talkedabout judgments the most notable was the bail granted to imprisoned intellectuals and activists including gautam navlakha for alleged maoist links he also delivered the hashimpura verdict convicting members of uttar pradesh provincial armed constabulary pac for the 1986 mass killings

he also convicted congress leader sajjan kumar in the 1984 antisikh riots case that year the judgment overturned the acquittals and passed stringent comments on the tardy prosecution

in april 2019 as delhi grappled with complaints of abnormal school fee hikes it was a justice muralidharled bench that held that the directorate of education does not have the power to audit the accounts of private schools the order came on a plea by the delhi government challenging a singlejudge order allowing schools to increase fees

also read indian courts speak of national interest but they order often in modi govts interest

a major grouse for lawyers in the delhi high court is that the collegium has not offered reasons for the transfer

jatan singh the vicepresident of the delhi high court bar association believes that the judge is being transferred without cogent reasons

justice muralidhar was going to be the seniormost judge of the delhi hc in a matter of few weeks whereas in punjab and haryana hc he will be a j2 or second seniormost judge singh said

why has this fact been disregarded he was not a judge who needed lawyers to tell him facts of a case he was wellversed with them beforehand parties did not matter for him as he was a judge with a spine

justice muralidhar is currently the third seniormost judge of the delhi hc he would however have become the second seniormost judge after chief justice dhirubhai naranbhai patel as the current second seniormost judge justice gs sistani is set to retire on 6 march

theprint had however reported that justice muralidhar is likely to be elevated to chief justice of the punjab and haryana high court in the near future

some of his verdicts have also been against the supreme court

justice muralidhar was part of the full bench in 2010 that ruled in favour of a petitioner who had filed an rti seeking information from the supreme court registry on how many judges had declared their assets

in a landmark verdict on 10 january 2010 delhi high court had held that the office of the chief justice of india comes within the ambit of the rti law saying judicial independence was not a judges privilege but a responsibility cast upon him or her

the 88page judgment was then seen as a personal setback to the then cji kg balakrishnan who had been opposed to the disclosure of information relating to judges under the rti act

one of the senior advocates in delhi claimed that the prolitigant and procitizen orders passed by justice muralidhar may have led to his transfer

issues with justice muralidhar have been arising ever since he has been passing procitizen and prolitigant orders there have been orders where justice muralidhar has castigated the agencies for being highhanded in their approach the senior lawyer said

there have however been earlier attempts to transfer justice muralidhar

when rss ideologue s gurumurthy tweeted against the judge dragging his personal life into the picture contempt proceedings were initiated against gurumurthy

the rss ideologue tendered an unconditional apology but soon after this a proposal to transfer justice muralidhar was discussed the idea was however shot down by the then cji ranjan gogoiled bench in january 2019

a part of the delhi legal fraternity sincerely believes that what happened in 2018 when the collegium sent back rajiv shakhder to the delhi high court could happen again

advocate js sodhi stated that since the judge is held to be extremely valuable by the delhi bar there were chances that what happened with former judge shakhder could happen in this case too

in january 2018 justice shakhder was back in the delhi high court about 20 months after his transfer to the madras high court the lawyer said his transfer had prompted many eminent jurists to write letters of protest and urge the then chief justice of india to reverse the decision the same thing can happen now too

in january 2015 justice shakdher had in a judgement allowed the amsterdam headquartered nongovernmental organisation greenpeace which was under the home ministrys scanner for alleged funding violations to access its funds

dressed in a black sports bra and powder blue leggings and using a long black resistance band the brunette beauty started the workout with a series of shoulder dislocations this exercise required her to repeatedly lift the resistance band behind her back rotating her shoulder joint in the process then she moved on to doing upright rows during which she lifted the band to her chin with the other end of it beneath both of her feet shoulder rotations came next which were followed by depressions this latter exercise meant that she had to pull the resistance band down positioning it behind her head

in the caption krissy stressed the importance of doing warmup exercises calling it the most important aspect of training krissy revealed that she thinks of it as an alarm clock for her muscles that wakes them up and lets them know shes about to work out she also mentioned their importance in protecting the body from injury and muscle strain

as of this writing the video has accumulated more than 17000 likes and over 180 instagram users have commented on it in those comments fans thanked her for the warmup demonstration

yes to this one person wrote shoulders always always need waking up

good motivation for my shoulders as my not fav to exercise another added

others asked her to upload more warmup demonstrations that target other areas of the body like the back

others used the post as an opportunity to compliment krissy

you look so pretty even when you work out a third commenter remarked

you look so pretty in this not that you dont always theres just something special about this a fourth person gushed

a post shared by krissy cela  workout with me krissycela on feb 20 2020 at 1212pm pst

this is krissys first workout video since her previous instagram post about the importance of rest in the caption that accompanied a video of her posing in a black sports bra and briefs she revealed that she hadnt exercised in a week and that her body was grateful for it

i felt a little bad at first because naturally you feel like youre not doing much but my body thanked me for it she said back to training tomorrow

the clip has been viewed more than 450000 times and over 600 instagram users have commented on it ; tammy hebrow is known across the internet for her insanely toned physique but the fitness influencer has been questioned about her real body following a recent instagram post

hembrow boasts over 11 million instagram followers across her personal and fitness accounts where she regularly shares snaps of her defined abs and trim waist

but the mum of two took to her fitness page to share her real body revealing her pregnancies with children wolf and saskia had a lasting effect on her body

posting a video of her standing in a crop top and underwear in her bathroom hembrow turned for the camera and pulled at the skin on her flat stomach

yes ive got loose skin on my stomach its just a reminder of my two babies and how incredible the human body is she captioned the clip

the 24yearold then plugged her fitness app but hundreds of fans were left frustrated by the post questioning what loose skin hembrow was claiming to show

i dont see any loose skin one wrote another adding where is the loose skin i just see abs

some called the clip cringeworthy pointing out that hembrow has barely any loose skin and criticising her for using the physical effects of motherhood to market her app

others claimed the influencer was setting unrealistic body standards for other mums many of whom struggle with excess loose skin stretch marks weight gain and other physical changes through pregnancy that can seriously impact their body image

on the flipside hundreds of hembrows fans praised her for the clip and reminded her critics that criticising the 24yearold for how much or how little loose skin she had was still harmful

thank you for sharing its nice to know everyone has it even really fit people a fellow mum replied to hembrows post

the fitness icon has faced backlash before for promoting unrealistic body standards but her most recent scandal came after posting a tone deaf snap in a bid to raise money for the australian bushfire relief efforts

hembrow struck a racy pose in a wet tshirt in the post which has since been deleted from her account ; ariana james took to social media earlier today to show off the abs that helped make her famous the bombshell has been flaunting her smoking hot body in a variety of scandalous outfits over the past few weeks but her last bikini shot dated all the way back to february 9 luckily james decided to slip into some seriously sexy swimwear in her most recent instagram update

in the gorgeous shot the model appeared on a balcony leaning against the glass and looking down below her she left little to the imagination while clad in a sexy bikini that featured a tight pink top that dipped low into her chest and showed off her insanely sculpted abs the social media star added a pair of dark multicolored bottoms that hit at her thigh showcasing her pert derriere and her sculpted legs

the model kept things simple wearing her long dark locks down and straight as they fell all the way down past her shoulders she appeared to be wearing minimal makeup with just a little bit of eyeliner and mascara letting her natural beauty shine through in the caption of the photo she wished her fans a good morning in spanish adding a simple red heart emoji as well the shot has only been live on her page for a matter of hours but its earning rave reviews already

a post shared by   ariana on feb 20 2020 at 624am pst

in addition to over 73000 likes the post has racked up 680 comments and that number continues to climb by the hour some insagrammers took to the photo to gush over james rock hard body while countless others simply let her know that they are huge fans a few more chimed in with emoji instead and the overwhelming majority of comments were in spanish

i love you so much ariana please notice me i am a fan one fan gushed adding a few flame emoji

wow very nice this photo it great another social media user wrote

your body is goals that is really all that i have to say about that a third fan raved

earlier this week the inquisitr reported that james sizzled in another hot little number that time one that wasnt quite as revealing but was just as sexy she posed on the same balcony as her most current photo but that time she sizzled in a curvehugging black bodysuit that fit her like a glove the strapless outfit also showed off her tanned shoulders and it comes as no surprise that fans went totally crazy for it ; by spreading a cloth on a table and using beverage cans as a net qi yuan and his parents can now play table tennis inside their home in lanzhou capital of northwest chinas gansu province

it is a good way to enhance immunity and develop his skills amid the coronavirus outbreak said qi yuans father qi feng

before the viral outbreak qi yuan regularly played with other kids at the tabletennis club near his home

though the pingpong table is rough and simple its a really interesting experience said qi feng

in fact many chinese families have figured out creative ways to pass time at home during the epidemic

sixthgrader zhang mengmeng skips rope on a mat i use the mat is to reduce the noise she said

because of the outbreak zhangs school postponed the new semester without a specific reopening date through the schools onlineteaching platform zhang can take some classes online but not her favorite physical education

to compensate zhangs parents encourage her to do simple physical exercises including jumping rope and dancing

ive downloaded a lot of videos to teach her aerobics said zhangs mother every evening after dinner we dance along with the teacher in the video

many chinese students are tapping into different online resources to enrich their lives and stay physically active

dressed in sportswear world gymnastics champion mo huilan performs an aerobics set on a livestreaming platform provided by youku a chinese youtubelike video website two of her nephews follow her step by step

mo said she custom designed the set for children i think children should do physical exercises at the age of three it strengthens their physical and mental health and improves their immunity mo said

recently youku invited several worldchampion athletes to teach children different indoor exercises

the epidemic requires students and their parents to attach more importance to keeping fit said li shaocheng a professor in the department of physical education at lanzhou university stayathome fitness also reflects chinese optimism during challenging times but parents and children must be aware of potential dangers and choose suitable indoor exercises ; fitness model jen selter often shares sizzling snaps of her sculpted physique with her 128 million instagram followers but in her latest instagram update she wasnt alone she included her furry fourlegged friend her dog gram selter who has his very own instagram account

the post was a double update and jen rocked a crop top and bikini bottoms in the smoking hot snaps the pictures were taken on a rooftop patio and though jen didnt include a geotag in the location of the post it was likely shot in her home base of new york city in the first shot the brunette bombshell kneeled on a neutral lounge chair that was flanked by small circular tables on either side her dog was on the lounge chair with her facing away from her as she rubbed his fur

jen rocked a bright red longsleeved crop top that showcased her chiselled abs and a pair of highcut bikini bottoms in the same bold hue the sides of the bikini bottoms stretched over her hips showing off her hourglass physique her long locks were parted in the middle and down in tousled waves and she had on no accessories besides a pair of sunglasses she flashed a huge smile at the camera in the picture

in the second snap jen showed off more of her sculpted physique  and her outfit she changed her position so that she was kneeling with gram sitting obediently on the lounge chair in front of her the front of jens crop top featured a scoop neckline that showcased a hint of cleavage

jen paired the sweet snaps of her dog and her in their rooftop photoshoot with a caption that acknowledged national pet day in the caption jen gave her followers a bit more information about how she brought the furry friend into her world

jens eager followers couldnt get enough of the sizzling and sweet update and the post received 48900 likes within just one hour as well as many comments from her fans

one fan was captivated by jens body and said gorgeous physique followed by two heart emoji

another couldnt get enough of her pet and said the cutest shot

the most beautiful rooftop view ive ever seen another fan added not clarifying whether he was referring to the landscape or to jen

love this your puppy is so cute another said

while she occasionally shares snaps in regular clothing jen seems to alternate between bikinis and workout gear just a few days ago as the inquisitr reported the stunner shared a snap in which she rocked a pair of highwaisted leggings and a matching sports bra in a printed whiteandpink pattern ; the age of convenience has created a world where many of us are able to pick up a smartphone and have a meal delivered in a matter of minutes purchase and have delivered a long list of products and services in a matter of hours and search for data and information in a matter of seconds on any subject convenience is the new currency as many say and in the decade ahead that label or term is only going to become more relevant

when it comes to our health and wellbeing however there can be long gaps of time where we do not check our blood pressure measure our weight evaluate our heart rate know what consumptions of calories we are undertaking or make an effort to be physically active and mentally balanced in a healthy way we may wait weeks or months to see a doctor if we have health issues furthermore information around our health is fragmented those tasks and other ways of handling matters relating to our health while improving in their availability and application still require a lot of unnecessary effort as defined by our modern era of convenience

the problem with how we keep ourselves healthy and fit also has significant economic consequences healthcare is a major cost worldwide and is estimated to account for 3 trillion in spending in the united states and 6 trillion globally healthcare spending in the five major world regions will reach 87 trillion by 2020 up from 7 trillion in 2015 global healthcare spending is projected to increase at an annual rate of 41 percent through 2021 up from just 13 percent in 2012 through 2016 as global populations age and increase in size developing market expansion in advanced medical treatments and rising labor costs will continue to drive spending growth the way we deliver health is simply grossly inefficient

the data sources needed and feedback loops optimized for maintaining and improving health and for some in how they may have to manage chronic conditions are disorganized not easy to understand and certainly inconvenient that is why in the coming decade the age of convenience will result in embedded health as being the future of health and fitness experiences what does that mean to embed something is to implant an idea or feeling within something else so it becomes an ingrained or essential characteristic of it when something becomes embedded it is fixed firmly and deeply in a surrounding mass it means being healthier without having to try as hard to do so the ultimate valuable convenience

what we will see in embedded health and fitness experiences is the integration of sensors into many many things in our world and the delivery of feedback and monitoring in ways that will make maintaining and improving health dramatically easier for people and in some surprising ways

here are just a few examples of what is emerging when it comes to the era of embedded health and fitness and what it will mean

automakers like bmw among others are investing in efforts to expand biometric systems that will turn automobiles into health trackers vehicles will soon offer heartrate monitoring among other features focused on the health of the driver

after all when you sit behind the wheel of a car youre already surrounded by advanced technology that is rapidly evolving and becoming more intelligent and responsive in the next few years cars and other vehicles are expected to offer a host of humanmonitoring technologies designed to enhance the safety and wellbeing of drivers

the longterm hope is that well have increased medical management of conditions like diabetes or high blood pressure by using automotive technology that monitors heart rate cardiac rhythm blood sugar and other measurements according to research scientist bryan reimer of the massachusetts institute of technologys agelab who studies the possible uses of advanced biometric technology in cars accurately measuring brain waves is the holy grail because that information would directly tell us much of what these other factors only indicate indirectly

the uk national health system nhs published a report last year on the future of digital technologies in healthcare and speech recognition used in conjunction with voice assistants is prominently highlighted preparing the healthcare workforce to deliver the digital future is a 100page report commissioned by the nhs secretary and led by us geneticist dr eric topol who is executive vice president and professor of molecular medicine at the scripps research institute

the report begins with this quote as people live longer but also with more longterm conditions there is an inexorable increase in the demand for healthcare

when we think about voice technology for healthcare two aspects should be considered the first provides assistance to clinicians offering access to more information faster and allowing more focus on the patient other use cases enable handsfree applications during surgery for example the other path is direct interaction in the home or wherever an individual may be as a virtual medical coach that can help patients manage diabetes depression and other chronic conditions companies like black  decker healthcare lifepod and orbita are today focused on offering health solutions that leverage general purpose voice assistants like amazon alexa

in the realm of fitness preventative health meditation and other primary prevention activities the collection of data from sensors on people will enable these health coaches to proactively use voice to interact with people provide guidance offer solutions and intervene when necessary

the apple watch and its built in ekg capabilities heart rate monitoring and fitness and nutrition tracking are early examples of how embedded health via voice will emerge once apples siri begins integrating all of your data and telling you to take more steps or asks you to mediate while eating an apple

the ultimate aspect of embedded health will entail our embedding more technologies directly into our bodies implantable sensor systems are not a new concept when we think of human medical tracking devices their development preceded modern medical device innovation which began to surge in the 60s think of pacemakers sensors were introduced with the advent of the space race in the 40s monitoring and broadcasting realtime biological parameters of dogs and chimps gray 1999

as technology evolves and is further tested future implantable sensors will show great promise for reforming and revolutionizing the health and fitness industry miniaturization of hardware will enable ingestibles smart hardware and software that not only tracks and uncovers information about a persons health but can treat it at the nano level

an example of where this is going is elon musks neuralink which hopes to implant the first chip in a human patient before the end of 2020 the ultimate hope is for some sort of symbiosis with artificial intelligence which he said would take root at the civilizational scale

there are abundant new opportunities that will emerge as we increasingly combine technology with human biology the resulting information and learning as it pertains to the next aspect of embedded health will be fantastic

artificial intelligence ai uses complex algorithms and software to emulate human cognition in the analysis of complicated data specifically ai enables computer algorithms to approximate conclusions about peoples health and wellbeing without direct human input

what distinguishes ai technology from traditional technologies in health fitness and wellbeing is the ability to use a lot of data from different sources process it and provide clear output to the humans who need it ai does this through machine learning algorithms these algorithms can recognize patterns in data and create its own logic how can a combination of sleeping patterns hormones and diet impact a persons prediabetic condition if an ai monitors millions of adults with millions of data points over time it will be able to learn and provide better coaching and direct ai to human interventions that lead individuals to better health

the primary purpose of health and fitness related ai applications is to analyze relationships between prevention or treatment techniques and patient health outcomes ai programs have been developed and applied to practices such as diagnosis processes treatment protocol development drug development personalized medicine and patient monitoring and care medical institutions such as the mayo clinic memorial sloan kettering cancer center and national health service have developed ai algorithms large technology companies such as ibm and google and startups such as welltok and ayasdi have developed ai algorithms as well for healthcare

our age of convenience and growing applications of technologies will lead to embedded health and fitness as the key dimension of realworld solutions for people in the process much of what we have known to be health and fitness experiences will be transformed into entirely new ways of being able to keep healthy these four examples in this article are but a few that represent what is to come

convenience is the new currency and in the decade ahead that term is only going to become more relevant when it comes to our health ; rapper boosie badazz says hes been kicked out of a planet fitness branch over comments he made on social media

digitization of the fitness industry will bolster developments in the digital fitness market

while the health and wellness trend has maintained its growth worldwide since the past decade micro trends in the wellness industry has undergone some digital transformations in the recent years though consumers are seeking ways to improve their fitness onpaper fitness plans have become obsolete nowadays as digital fitness enables consumers to keep track of their fitness activities and monitor their progress towards their fitness goals the fitness industry has been transitioning towards digitization rapidly

growing awareness about the convenience and fitness efficiency associated with using digital fitness devices and products is resulting in the increased popularity of digital fitness thereby rapidly transforming fitness industry is expected to trigger innovations and more developments in the digital fitness market in the upcoming years

leading players in the digital fitness market offer subscription models to boost product sales

a large percentage of the millennial population of the world is embracing the digital fitness trend by resorting to sports and fitness apps consumers are focused on following a healthy lifestyle by understanding the radical changes in their health and physical fitness taking into account the inclination of consumers towards digital fitness devices leading players in the digital fitness market are introducing attractive fitness subscription models to their potential consumers to boost their product sales more consumers are preferring to pay for digital fitness programs rather than paying for a traditional gym membership which is expected to increased popularity of digital fitness subscriptions in the upcoming years ; january is a time when many people make resolutions  and then break them almost 60 of americans will resolve to exercise more but fewer than 10 will stick with their resolution a key to keeping resolutions is ensuring they are measurable and a simple way to track activity is through a wearable smartwatch or fitness tracker indeed almost one in five adults has used a fitness tracker

wearable fitness trackers can also help improve medical care by providing insights into physical activity heart rate location and sleep patterns my research team uses wearable fitness tracker data with smart home sensors to help older adults live safely and independently we also study wearable fitness tracker data along with electronic medical records and genomic data to investigate the causes of gestational diabetes many other researchers utilize wearable fitness trackers to better understand how lifestyles can impact health

unfortunately ive found in my health informatics research that wearable devices may not give all the credit their users deserve and in some cases users may want to consider how secure and private their data is

people who use fitness trackers have been frustrated with how they get credit for their activities which drives some users to abandon fitness trackers in my research teams work we find that people who have limited arm movement report that fitness trackers are not accurately recording their activities this can happen as well with those who do not have traditional gaits because they may shuffle

the lack of credit is especially obvious when people are walking but keeping their arms still  such as pushing a stroller or walking while holding an infant new mothers also report accuracy issues with respect to their sleep patterns when they wake up multiple times a night the next morning the device will show them as lightly sleeping this is frustrating when the new mother wants to use this data to negotiate with her partner on child care because a device may credit the mother with more sleep than she actually gets

these inaccuracies make sense from a technical point of view when people keep their wrists still as in pushing a stroller the wrist is not changing directions thus the software cannot detect changes in movement from the accelerometer sensor on a wrist tracker which is looking for changes in updown forwardbackward and sidetoside movements researchers have also shown that 500 or fewer steps can be recorded without wearing the device reflecting how devices can over count activity sometimes in the case of detecting sleep most people do not wake up multiple times a night so the algorithms used by wearable devices may throw these short bursts of movement away

the companies that make these wearable devices have significant intellectual property involved in detecting these movements and then using algorithms to decide how much people are moving or sleeping so these algorithms are not shared publicly there currently do not exist any mechanisms to give feedback on what was detected imagine if a person could push a button and tell a wearable fitness device i did wake up three times tonight

since people are not getting the credit they deserve for some of their activities i am concerned about what type of lifestyle data we researchers can accurately assess from a commodity wearable for our health research in computing there is a saying garbage in garbage out if wearable fitness trackers are putting inaccurate step and sleep data into the algorithms that quantify our activities then people will be making healthrelated decisions based on inaccurate data

typically consumers assess how much credit they are getting from a fitness tracker by transferring the data to an app most people likely assume that when people transfer the data to the app the data is not shared widely users may assume for instance that they can see the data people they shared data with can view it and the company who has the device and app can see the data but this is only part of the story

a company however could change its terms of service  which studies have shown people have difficulty understanding  and decide to make this health data available to third parties for example wearable fitness data could be sold to help our employers understand our fitness and productivity or insurance companies to assist with or deny health coverage although theres no evidence of this practice being done i believe consumers would do well to be aware that it is a possibility in the future ; goqii fitness tracker has a very unique way of improving your health

the camera zoomed in on michelles upper body as upbeat latin music played in the background the stunning fitness enthusiast gave the camera a flirty smile but she didnt stop exercising her husband swedish bodybuilder jimmy lewin began providing narration for the video as the camera circled michelle it stopped when it reached the blond bombshells peachy backside pausing to give fans an upclose view of the scrunchbutt back of her skintight leggings

alright guys i know shes hot and all that but here in this video theres nothing to see   jimmy began

the bodybuilder stuttered a bit when his wifes backside came into view the camera then slowly panned down michelles shapely legs

jimmy must workout had me fooled read a third response to michelles post

lmfaoooo love your videos gushed a fourth admirer

as previously reported by the inquisitr michelle delighted her fans last week by sharing a different crazy video on her instagram page it included previously unseen footage of the time a wild pig bit her on the butt when she was vacationing in the bahamas ; chelsea are concerned about the fitness of star midfielder ngolo kante

the blues have a key premier league clash against tottenham at the weekend

they are hoping to hold onto their fourth place in the league which has come under threat after a run of one win in six games

and the evening standard suggests that kante who got injured early on against manchester united on monday could miss the game

he is struggling with a groin injury that could keep him out for three weeks per the report

kantes absence means that mason mount may have to come into the midfield and play next to jorginho and matteo kovacic

chelsea have missed kante this season as he has only managed 16 premier league starts ; birmingham city face sheffield wednesday at st andrews on saturday hoping to have their one transfer window signing available to play

hogan hope

pep clotet admits he is preparing without scott hogan for birmingham citys clash with sheffield wednesday

the aston villa striker was hurt in the 11 draw with brentford hobbling off in the second half after a heavy challenge by ethan pinnock

hogan is still recuperating forcing clotet to consider other tactical approaches as he looks to extend the clubs unbeaten run to 11 games

he is a doubt the head coach said i have been working on other options because he is still a doubt

he has been working on his ankle a decision will have to be made tomorrow or on saturday

kerim mrabti is not yet ready after his hamstring problem while jacques maghoma is still sidelined with a quad issue

jacques and kerim still have a few weeks left in recovery clotet continued

they are doing well we hope they can get back as soon as possible because they are important in the team kerim is less than jacques

maikel kieftenbeld could play for the first time since suffering knee ligament damage having been an unused substitute against the bees

if hogan doesnt make it clotet could turn to dan crowley who came off the bench to play just behind lukas jutkiewicz towards the end of the last game

jeremie bela can also play through the middle and jude bellingham has operated both as a falsenine and no 10 in his breakthrough season

inside track

sheffield wednesday arrive at st andrews on saturday looking to arrest their slide and deliver a blow to birmingham citys recent improvement

the match represents a first return for garry monk since his summer sacking  and a resumption of hostilities with pep clotet

while the teams seem to be moving in opposite directions so far in 2020 the fact is they are locked together in midtable with 44 points apiece and only faith playoff hopes

while blues have taken ten of the 12 points on offer in february wednesday have managed only two and turn up having lost to luton and reading

we spoke to the sheffield stars owls writer alex miller for an insight into how monk is faring at hillsborough

describe sheffield wednesdays season for us

am to coin a comedy football cliché  its been a season of two halves jeff

wednesday were third at christmas and building momentum on a return to the playoffs after two years out

but a run of one win in 10 matches since has killed that campaign and all of a sudden pressure is mounting on garry monk  who joined six matches into the season

the whole saga has been set to the soundtrack of an ongoing efl charge of misconduct that could see the owls deducted points  your readers know all too well how much monk knows about that  and that threat is becoming more and more threatening as the lower reaches of the division edge closer

attendances are down theyve not scored at hillsborough in 2020 and the mood around wednesday is pretty dour

what changes has garry monk made

am setting up his stall to shore things up monk made tweaks rather than vast changes to the side caretaker boss lee bullen had started well with

but the big decisions have caused controversy among the fans experienced pair keiren westwood and sam hutchinson are training with the under23s as monk looks to the future and he spoke about knowing what a successful changing room looks like in response to a question about them last week

cameron dawson a 24yearold wednesdayite has come in between the sticks and has signed a fouryear contract and there have been several tinkerings with the side in recent weeks

much more here

offer the hand

pep clotet will try for a second time to shake garry monks hand when his predecessor in the birmingham city hotseat returns to st andrews

monk who led blues to a comfortable campaign in difficult circumstances last season brings his underfire sheffield wednesday team to the second city on saturday

he does so having been part of a 11 draw between the clubs in november a game more memorable for events off the field than on it

monk criticised his former assistant in the buildup to that match and ignored the spaniard when he offered his hand before kickoff

asked he will offer his hand again the spaniard was unequivocal

yes i will act normally like any other game like any other manager he said

i say exactly the same as i did in the first one

poll loading have birmingham city got a realistic chance of reaching the playoffs this season 500 votes so far yes  ten unbeaten anythings possible no  weve left ourselves with too much to do

for me i am representing birmingham city and i will do it with dignity with respect to whoever

after 20 years in this business i am not up for things anymore

its about manners respect the club with dignity act accordingly its more important than anything else in my opinion

clotet also urged blues fans to focus on their own team

i dont know really about the reception because i dont know how the fans will react what i hope is that the fans back our team one hundred per cent from the beginning

because what i saw on saturday a few moments in the game when we are together in one we are a different animal at st andrews

thats what i want to see i really would like to ask our fans to get behind the team from the beginning and make the opposition feel this is a tough place to come and visit

especially a team like that which has individuals who can win them the game

loan latest

pep clotet has explained why blues knocked back a loan request for backup goalkeeper connal trueman

the 23yearold was the subject of an approach by league one outfit southend united but the head coach rejected it

he said southend enquired about an emergency loan the club said the decision this week was on me and i decided not to proceed because i have the feeling the squad is thin enough and i didnt want to alter this balance ; the study expected to be presented thursday at the american stroke associations international stroke conference in new orleans showed 30 minutes or more of brisk walking or an equivalent aerobic activity five days a week could lower stroke risk by about 40 percent

fitness has a protective effect regardless of the presence or absence of other stroke risk factors including family history of cardiovascular disease diabetes high blood pressure elevated cholesterol levels and high body mass index study author steven hooker said in a prepared statement

this study is the first to suggest there may be a significant independent association between cardiorespiratory fitness crf and fatal and nonfatal stroke in men and nonfatal stroke in women said hooker director of the prevention research center at the university of south carolina arnold school of public health

about 780000 us adults suffer a stroke each year and stroke is a leading cause of serious longterm disability in the united states according to the american stroke association about 150000 people die from strokes annually making it the nations no 3 cause of death

researchers analyzed data on more than 60000 people  46405 men and 15282 women  who participated in a longterm study at the cooper aerobics center in dallas between 1970 and 2001 the participants aged 18 to 100 and free of known cardiovascular disease when they entered the study were followed for an average of 18 years during that time 863 people  692 men and 171 women  had strokes

upon entering the study each participant took a test to measure cardiorespiratory fitness in which they walked on a treadmill at an increasing grade andor speed until they reached their maximal aerobic capacity

men in the highest quartile 25 percent of crf had a 40 percent lower relative risk of stroke compared with men in the lowest quartile that difference stayed constant even after adjusting for other factors such as smoking alcohol intake family history of cardiovascular disease bodymass index an estimation of body fatness high blood pressure diabetes and high cholesterol levels hooker said

among women those with a higher cardiorespiratory fitness level had a 43 percent lower relative risk than those in the lowest fitness level

the overall stroke risk dropped substantially at the moderate crf level with the protective effect persisting almost unchanged through higher fitness levels

we found that a lowtomoderate amount of aerobic fitness for men and women across the whole adult age spectrum would be enough to substantially reduce stroke risk hooker said

physical activity is a major modifiable cardiovascular disease risk factor increasing the nations crf through regular physical activity could be a vital weapon to lower the incidence of stroke in men and women he said

one of the studys limitations is that most of the participants were white welleducated and middleupper income hooker said he recommended that data be collected from other populations

staying active can be a challenge for the more than 6 million children with asthma in the united states noted dr tod olin hes a pediatric pulmonary specialist at national jewish health in denver

it can be a dilemma for many families all it takes is one asthma attack and suddenly patients can become very tentative about overdoing it he said in a hospital news release

when it comes to cardio activities that are welltolerated swimming specifically is highly recommended particularly in indoor swimming pools olin said

the high humidity in indoor swimming pools protects against asthma attacks by keeping airways open he said

we think that the way asthma attacks happen is that the airways dry out and that sets off a cascade of reactions that ultimately squeezes down the airway olin explained if we can prevent that initial airwaydrying step by staying in a humid environment we prevent the asthma attack all together

children with asthma have often been told to limit exercise he noted more recently weve changed our approach he said we now encourage kids to exercise especially as the obesity epidemic has become more and more problematic

starting with swimming and letting kids with asthma choose the sports they enjoy make it more likely they will stay active he said

i generally recommend that they use their albuterol inhaler about 15 minutes before exercise but if their asthma is wellcontrolled there is no reason to limit any activity olin said if their heart is taking them toward a certain sport they should be encouraged to pursue that ; tuesday feb 19 healthday news  although physical activity can help boost your immune system people who are sick should tone down their workout or skip it altogether experts advise

regular exercise is a great way to reduce stress and sleep better at night this helps boost your immune system however vigorous exercise and extreme conditioning can have a negative impact on your health if youre sick joe berg a personal trainer and fitness specialist at loyola center for health said in a loyola university news release

when fighting a viral illness its best to keep your exercise session short and not as intense if you have a fever or stomach bug it might be best to hold off berg added

for those recovering from an illness its best to ease back into a workout routine slowly berg recommends starting small with some light aerobics such as walking and cycling at an easy pace as well as body weight squats pushups and planks in the plank exercise you rest your weight on your forearms with your elbows directly beneath your shoulders keeping your body in a straight line from your head to your feet

these exercises cover the major muscles of the body and when performed in moderation can help boost your immune system explained berg

for people worried about being exposed to germs at the gym valerie walkowiak medical integration coordinator at the loyola center for fitness pointed out that heading outside or working out at home may be a good way to stay healthy and fit during the cold and flu season

weather permitting its always great to just get out of the house and walk or run to get in some cardio exercise just make sure you wear the proper clothes to keep warm this includes layers of clothing a hat scarf gloves and appropriate shoes said walkowiak

when the weather makes exercising outdoors impossible there are ways people can work out at home  even if they dont have special equipment walkowiak said you can get your heart rate up without leaving the house by climbing the stairs jogging in place or doing jumping jacks she added that a homebased circuit training routine can be created by alternating two to three minutes of these cardio exercises with 30 to 60 seconds of strengthtraining moves such as pushups squats seated rows or heel raises

you dont have to have dumbbells bands or tubing to get in some strength training at home try using household items to add resistance such as soup cans gallon jugs of water or your own body weight walkowiak noted

in order to target all the muscle groups walkowiak recommended doing the following exercises

damn what are you made of one instagram user commented

im really inspired by you another follower wrote ; former hoffenheim sporting director ernst tanner has spoken of signing liverpool star roberto firmino

tanner admits when they snapped up the figueirense attacker almost ten years ago his fitness stats were nothing short of shocking

he said i went over to brazil twice that year but it wasnt easy to get the right impression on firmino during a game because he didnt actually play regularly

with the world cup being held that season they had a break in the summer and you know how tight the national calendar is over there which roughly means that they play saturday then wednesday and then saturday again

in between they need to travel so it was very hard even to follow him in training but we managed to get into the stadium facilities as tourists to watch him working

there was one specific session where i said ok this was the right type of player hes bringing along the right mentality hes eager to learn he works hard  what we saw in training was far better than in game that was the reason why we took that decision we had also sent a scout over but his report was negative on him

despite firmino convincing hoffenheim of his talent the german club did have major concerns about his fitness during his early days with the club

in fact tanner says that the brazilian posted some of the worst numbers seen in endurance tests labelling the results worse than my grandma

he told the bleacher report you should have seen the data that we got on him when he was coming for the first time to hoffenheim in germany we usually do these endurance tests blood ones which are pretty accurate you know and he had the worst numbers i have ever seen in professional football

i would say to emphasise that he was even worse than my grandma you cant imagine they were so low that you couldnt even believe that he was ever able to play professional football ; dubai crown prince opens salem medical fitness centre pictures courtesy wam

q how do you see the future of pilates in india

yasmin i definitely see all of india doing pilates because its such a beautiful form of exercise that works on your awareness your breath your control centering concentration these are all some of the principles of pilates it works on your posture your spine every movement is so precise that it helps you with everything in life and i believe that pilates makes everything else that you do in life better so i just feel that everybody should be doing pilates in india because its such an amazing form of exercise

q whats your expansion plan in the near future

yasmin my future plan is to have one pilates studio in every city of our country im hoping that will happen one day but until then i am on youtube doing pilates exercises every thursday for people to follow in their homes so until we are there in every city im sure people in every city can follow my videos on youtube and get more familiar with the form of exercise

q how different is pilates from the regular gym

yasmin every form of exercise or sport has a different intention as to why it was invented for example martial arts were invented for self defence yoga was invented as a means to be closer to your spiritual self and the gym or weight lifting was invented for building muscle using weights pilates was invented for one reason alone to make the human body move as efficiently as possible if your biceps are stronger than your triceps your arm will not move efficiently if you have a six pack or strong rectus abdominis muscles but weak back muscles you will end up injuring yourself pilates ensures that your entirely body develops long lean muscles evenly throughout the front and back the upper and lower hemispheres so that the body can move as efficiently as possible when your body moves efficiently it saves energy which can be used in other parts of your life pilates literally makes you move better and live better

q top 5 tips and reasons why people should join pilates

yasmin

it is the perfect combination between strength training and stretching

it nonaggressive form of exercise with incredible results

it works on your posture and strengthens your spine and all the muscles around it

it helps to strengthen your core and when your core is strong all other movements in life get easier and better

it forces you to breathe for an hour which makes you feel rejuvenated and refreshed while giving you a great workout

q what is your fitness regime

yasmin i do one hour of pilates a day and 1 hour of cardio everyday sunday is my rest day where i make sure i get a massage

q one common mistake that people make while trying to lose weight

yasmin crash dieting its the worst thing to go an any kind of an extreme diet because i its not sustainable ii your body doesnt get the nutrients that it needs iii higher chances of getting injured and iv really isnt good for your body in the long run

q how important is it for people especially women to understand the importance of being fit rather than thin

yasmin it is extremely important to be fit women run behind being thin and a certain size whereas what is more important is your energy levels during the day and how you are feeling how much you are able to accomplish and how easily you are able to do your daily tasks whats the point of being thin and weak rather be fit and strong

in germany we usually do these endurance tests blood ones which are pretty accurate you know and he had the worst numbers i have ever seen in professional football

i would say to emphasise that he was even worse than my grandma you cant imagine they were so low that you couldnt even believe that he was ever able to play professional football

however tanner was a big fan of the youngsters hard working attitude which convinced him to push through a move for firmino despite some reservations over his potential

i went over to brazil twice that year but it wasnt easy to get the right impression on firmino during a game because he didnt actually play regularly he added

with the world cup being held that season they had a break in the summer and you know how tight the national calendar is over there which roughly means that they play saturday then wednesday and then saturday again

at the bombolulu cultural centre amphitheatre ogeno has assembled men and women in wheelchairs

ogeno said that picked up the idea of having a training session for persons with physical disabilities three years ago when he met a man on a wheelchair in the streets of mombasa but with a protruding belly and having lots of difficulties in navigating the wheelchair

i helped push him to his destination and later engaged him on the need to start exercising he was cooperative and we started with a simple exercise like upper body stretches dynamic movements for toning and flexibility these made it easier for him to move around without being assisted ogeno said

ogeno said that he monitored the man for a while and could see that his cardiovascular endurance improved too

i am determined to help both the normal person and those who have some form of disability hit the gym for some worthy workouts to keep fit and stay healthy he said

for 40yearold wheelchair basketballer and sitting volleyball peter ouma the training offered by ogeno could not have come at a special time

 i am already involved in playing basketball for wheelchair team and extra practise gives me due advantage over the rest in the team i love these sessions and will not miss a single day he said

 i sit most of the time and had developed pain in one of my arms but after the first training the pain eased i am here to train and follow that my trainer wants me to do she said

ogeno noted that people with disabilities also face a number of barriers to exercise

skill at using a wheelchair fatigue pain heat sensitivity and selfefficacy have been proposed as barriers to physical activity he said

he added that individuals who only sometimes need a wheelchair may not be comfortable with their wheelchair skills and therefore may not participate in wheelchair sports or physical activities

studies have shown that physical activity has been shown to improve body composition glucose metabolism and lipid profiles

 as starters we conduct some very simplified moderate aerobic exercise backed by music at least thrice a week and strength exercise for each major functioning muscle group twice per weekogeno is quick to point out that for the safety of all his students there is a need to acquire specialised equipment which at the moment they are lacking

the instagram pictures did not show the morning television host but instead was an ode to friend and personal trainer anna kaiser on her birthday in the first picture of the series that kelly shared anna stood with her knees bent and legs wide apart bending forward at the waist so her long blonde hair kept her nude body strategically covered and in compliance with the sites strict rules against overt nudity the picture obscured annas face making it hard to tell for those scrolling through instagram if kelly had shared a nude image of herself

the cover image for series seemed to fool a lot of kellys fans who thought that the nude body and long blonde hair belonged to her

is it you in the first pic one fan wrote adding an emoji with its mouth opened wide

the rest of the pictures more clearly showed kaiser and to avoid the confusion she also tagged the fitness trainer in the caption kelly wished her pal  who she referred to as a tiny package with big ballzzzz  a happy birthday

preston north end manager alex neil expects to be without daniel johnson for tomorrows match at west brom

the lilywhites hit the road to take on slaven bilics men following saturdays 21 win over hull city at deepdale

its a stern test for pne who will lock horns with the league leaders albeit north ends record against the top six this season is impressive

johnson was absent from the match day squad at the weekend and the preston boss wont have him available on tuesday night either

im not sure dj is going to make it said neil its his knee the same thing

its not something where im thinking hes going to be out for a long period of time

obviously we could do with it being better as quickly as possible because our record with him being available has been very good

hed been carrying it for a little bit but it wasnt restricting him  he was getting through games and training without having a great deal of pain

it was discomfort more than anything else he just came to the end of a training session and said he cant continue with it

weve had it scanned since then and its just inflamed a little bit

while neil will be without a key player in the middle of the park so too will slaven bilic

west brom midfielder romaine sawyers was sent off in albions win at bristol city last time out

north ends manager alluded to the fact both teams will be missing a similar style of player tomorrow night

hes played deeper he didnt used to at brentford said neil but to be honest he is similar to dj in the fact both players can do a bit of both

if they need to be high up the pitch and creative they can if they need to drop out and start rebuilding they can

both are technically excellent and i think hell certainly be a miss for them

when youve got your team settled and have the rhythm of players doing what they do well you dont really want to disrupt that

weve got key components in certain areas of our midfield and sometimes when you take that out you need to find an alternative ; even as realme x50 pro launched today phone maker realme is teasing more new smart devices as part of its plans to take on xiaomi realme released a teaser video confirming some of the smart products it has planned for 2020 the 60second video shared on twitter by ceo madhav sheth showcases already launched realme buds air upcoming devices like realme fitness band and realme tv among others the video shows at least seven upcoming products from the company which include a fitness band smartwatch smart clock smart speaker car charger smart weighing scale and a smart tv besides the video teased the seamless connectivity of these products with each other the video shows realme buds air paired with the smartwatch and the smart speaker connected with the smart tv

fitness being the need of the hour today has its presence felt in almost all the emerging domains and the indian realty market is no exception today as we live in a facedpaced world where time constraints seem to be the major issue people hardly get the time to work out and stay fit due to the round the clock corporate work culture sweating it out at the fitness centre is totally ruled out for the modernday inhabitants hence today buyers are on a lookout for fitness amenities within the confines of the township that can majorly facilitate in fulfilling their fitness goals

the presentday home buyer is not just keen on owning an exceptional property alone but today open spaces and highend facilities have equally become significant parameters on which the buyers decision is based prior to investing for long the indian real estate developers and builders have banked on the quality of realty properties that have been developed as a means to encourage probable buyers and investors who are keen on capitalizing in residential as well as commercial properties in current times there has been a vast alteration in this pattern this is because the modernday buyers are scouting for more and beyond quality they are more inclined towards investing in and opting for properties that offer the desired amenities and convenience like clubhouse equipped with advanced gymnasiums with the provision of open space reserves osr

sports and leisure facilities like squash courts tennis lawns ground for football and cricket play area for children gazebos spas yoga and meditation centres steam and sauna baths now rule the amenity list that is currently being delivered to healthfocused indian home buyers by developers this is a clear signal pointing out towards the escalating demands of buyers in pursuit of a holistic lifestyle on a salubrious front

today there exists an unrelenting demand profile in a market environment wherein potential home investors are being spoiledforchoice this has nothing but led to the forcefeeding of a new reality trend ie the aspect of wellness as one of the key factors in home purchase along with the consideration of the location in terms of investment infrastructural development and recreational facilities

an important characteristic that is lacking in the fitness space of indian realty is the provision of open spaces natural reserves and national parks the mounting suburb of borivali east has ample of recreational and outdoor spaces and parks like sanjay gandhi national park that offer a plenty of avenues for fitness fanatics to fulfil their wellness goals to further add to the health quotient of the residents of borivali east the sgnp ties up with reputed and well know gymnasiums as their fitness partners to organize the big fat marathon which is a 5 and 10 km run at the park the run majorly helps to promote the importance of fitness and healthy living among the inhabitants

to further create a room for wellness in the real estate projects the indian government is now keen on authorizing open spaces for housing projects due to this more and more township builders are now revolutionizing by placing courts and leisure areas on a higher floor thereby containing them in the building footprint facilities like swimming pools and gardens are now being situated on terraces thereby safeguarding better sales velocity or value appreciation for their buyer community

the newest generation of projects are envisioned more considerately and are definitely more residentcentric in contemporary times amenities play an integral role to the aspirational homebuyers in a spaceconstrained metro city such as mumbai planning for the right amalgam of amenities is all the more decisive developers are taking an active part in undertaking a comprehensive model which will not only be a right product combination but will also turn out to sustainable in the long run the advantageous chemistry of these amenities  surely is the novel fulcrum of an optimistic influence on the sector ; wyze initially made a name for itself offering home security devices for low prices but a major data leak at the end of 2019  where the sensitive information of 24 million customers was exposed  has put big question marks over its reputation as a security company nonetheless wyze seems determined to put its past transgressions behind it and is working on a bunch of new products  one of the more interesting of which is the wyze band with alexa

in a recent product update wyze outlined its plans for the wyze lock outdoor camera scale and doorbell cam as well as the wyze band official information on the device is a little thin but zatznotfunny has unearthed more details on what we can expect as well as the usual activity tracking features and weather tools the band will let users control wyze devices straight from their wrist as well as any number of alexa devices thanks to builtin alexa capabilities smart phone notifications also appear to be included in the color screen device  ; newswirenet  february 28 2020  a new bodyweight fitness app has been launched called primalthenics app it is a multifaceted home based workout program to help people achieve their health and fitness goals

gorgeous as always i absolutely love your posts thank you for all the tips they make so much of an impact in helping me out personally within my fitness journey another fan wrote along with a number of red heart emoji ; using the encode consortium copynumber data we reanalyzed our previous screening results in k562 and hela cells two cell lines with known copynumber variations cnvs in contrast the third cell line used in our study gm12878 has a relatively normal karyotype in k562 cells among the 230 essential lncrnas identified from the splicingtargeting screening 28 show copynumber amplifications tables 1 and 2 and 19 of these 28 are located within amplified regions in chromosome 22 many of these lncrnas are indeed topranked from our screening it is therefore possible that cnvs influenced the screening scores thus generating falsepositive hits ; charltons trip to sheffield wednesday midweek may be boosted by the fact the owls may be missing key duo steven fletcher and morgan fox

both players made cameo appearances for garry monks men from the bench in their 33 outing at birmingham on the weekend but the manager revealed both are well short of fitness

fletcher who was operatorinchief in wednesdays 31 win over the addicks at the valley in august when he scored a brace is still yet to fully recover knee injury picked up in early january while fox only made his return after four games out at the weekend

foxy and fletch are not fully fit at all monk said

the way we are with the couple of injuries we have had where we are at and what we need to do we have been forced into that situation

if we were in a better position in terms of the results we have had recently you would be able to give them a little bit longer they are not fully fit but its needs must

fletcher has become an influential player for monk scoring 12 goals this term which gave the owls an outside chance to gatecrash the playoffs its no coincidence that their topsix hopes hit problems during the former sunderland mans absence

despite his importance monk insisted he wont rush fletcher back and a place on the bench for lee bowyers visit is most likely for the 32yearold

for fletch yes hes only been training for three days monk continued

he was a big part a massive part of the reason why we were third at christmas and then to lose himits no excuse we havent done well enough in the period we have had but today was much better allround performance

that draw at birmingham left wednesday with just one win in their last 11 league games dropping them to 12th in the league 11 points off the playoff places and now just six ahead of the addicks who picked up a crucial win over strugglers luton on saturday ; savannah prez showcased her massive quads to her 701000 instagram followers on monday february 24 to encourage users to get started on their fitness journey by purchasing her ebook

biggest inspiration said a third fan following the words with hands raised and a red heart ; detroit  the detroit police department is looking for a few good men and women  400 or so by years end

money is no longer the problem since the city can afford to make a 500000 advertisement buy the challenge is getting the word out on the job openings and filling them

weve got the money to hire 200 officers right now detroit mayor mike duggan said the budget isnt the problem anymore

the ultimate goal is to recruit enough candidates to eventually make 400 hires duggan said

the cash crunch that drove detroit into bankruptcy also took a toll on paying and keeping police officers now that the city is six years out of bankruptcy the highly visible recruiting push is attempting to show candidates that detroit has emerged from financial distress and can afford to pay its law enforcement officers better

when james craig rejoined the detroit police department as chief in 2013  he started with the department in 1977 but layoffs led him to spend his formative years with the los angeles police department  starting pay was 29000 a year he said

now it has risen to 40000 duggan said and will increase again to 42000 in july

thats still below suburban departments the mayor said but were hoping to bust the myth that we dont have resources we are making huge investments in the department i wish i could give every precinct commander another 10 or 15 officers to put on the street

the city has long faced suburban competition for already trained earlycareer detroit police officers craig said this year it already has lost 10 officers to its regional neighbors he said

but as starting salaries rise the city can better compete with communities throughout metro detroit although detroit has more violent crime it also has more opportunities for varied work and more policing challenges

in a suburban department you might not ever get to work in an investigative unit or on surveillance fly a helicopter work a marine unit or be a k9 or swat officer craig said

in some cities you can be a patrol officer for 20 years duggan said

that said policing is a dangerous job craig admitted i applaud the courageous young people who join the police service and who continue to want to serve after colleagues die in the line of duty

in november officer rasheen mcclain died in an ambush while investigating a home invasion on detroits west side he was the 228th police officer in the departments history killed in the line of duty

more weve had far too many of these detroit mourns slain police officer

detroit was americas most violent city in 2018 the last numbers available according to federal bureau of investigation data

more crime drops in detroit fbis most violent big city

the campaign will start with two video ads 30 seconds and 40 seconds long

the shorter ad starts with a young black male putting on his running gear

ive always been a runner but ive never run from anything he says and neither has my city

do you want to be a detroit police officer challenges a police academy instructor his face inches from the recruits

sir yes sir the recruit responds eyes fixed forward

another instructor leads a class through pushups

its something special to protect the people closest to you the ones youve known all your life says the young man now a trained and sworn officer your neighbors your friends

his mother looks at him admiringly he straightens his badge 2501 pay starts the ad advises at 40000 annually

i was born in this city the officer says and im not going anywhere

the campaign includes digital media posters and billboards said lashinda stair first assistant chief

were hoping that people within the city see those things because theyre all within the parameters of the city of detroit stair said

all candidates are welcome though as the department casts a wide recruiting net to replace retirees the department hired 304 officers last year stair said

while the number seems large duggan said it barely allowed the city to keep pace with retirements

since the ad campaign started in late january applications are up 35 stair said

the detroit police academy is demanding said assistant chief james white it entails 80100 additional hours of training above the 594 hours required by the states police certification body the michigan commission on law enforcement standards white said

the department has tried to remove any costrelated barriers that might lead applicants to shy away participating in the academy is mostly free aside from some outofpocket costs candidates start date is when their training starts and training is paid white said

the next barrier to remove is that candidates be physically ready when academy training starts

while about 90 of people who start detroit police academy training complete it the inability to pass the mcoles physical fitness qualification held back 60 to 70 of those who dont finish craig said

in the past the department would urge outofshape candidates to improve their fitness and try again in a few months craig said but people still needed to find work in the meantime and often those who found it never reapplied for the police force

people get in the best shape of their life at police academy white said but its not a place id recommend to get in shape

so in january the department started a 90day cadet program which helps wouldbe candidates attain the physical fitness necessary for police academy training ahead of time cadets are paid 15 an hour

police academy is quite physical white said but its not something you cant accomplish if you put your mind to it we have instructors that will work with you on nutrition we give you yoga classes its a great opportunity for someone who is thinking about it but needs to shore some things up physically or recommit themselves to exercise

two cadets have already joined the police academy craig said

desmond hill 37 stopped by the police departments recruiting table last week at a job fair in the northwest activities center on meyers

im interested in like surveillance and it and stuff like that so part of doing that for the police department is going through the training process said hill who used a crutch that day

hill said he dislocated his knee while helping his sister move

the knee popped out popped back hill said but he planned to be back up and running in a few weeks perhaps training for the rigors of the police academy

im a detroiter man born and raised ive been shot at ive been stabbed straight as in school but the neighborhood i grew up in wasnt safe he said if i can take my love for video and technology and be a benefit to my community so it can be easier for kids now than it was for me thats a nobrainer ; brevard county florida  in the latest edition of sit down with steve the friday night locker rooms steve wilson talks with health  fitness expert alethea todaro

sunsport can reveal the hoops striker has been declared fit for sundays league clash with kilmarnock

neil lennon had to do without griff for the europa league match in denmark

but the hitman trained yesterday and has been given the allclear to return to action skipper scott brown limped off with a calf strain in the euro first leg

the full extent of his injury not yet been determined

elsewhere brendan rodgers will make a 25million bid to sign callum mcgregor this summer

the leicester city boss failed in an approach for the hoops midfielder last august

rodgers is now set to make a second attempt to land mcgregor at the end of the season

the foxes gaffer is braced for a massive 80m man united bid for star midfielder james maddison

but its understood rodgers wants mcgregor regardless of whether the england man moves on or not

the former celtic boss helped take the midfielders game to a new level during his twoandahalf years at parkhead

he was keen to bring him to leicester for the start of this campaign  but was told to back off

celtic chiefs then handed mcgregor a bumper new fiveyear deal in november with a massive pay hike

the scotland star is now hoops vicecaptain and neil lennon wont want to lose him in the summer

but rodgers is prepared to push the boat out and a 25m bid would match the record fee arsenal paid for kieran tierney

and the leicester boss is confident that would be enough to land the 26yearold at the second attempt

mcgregor could captain celtic against kilmarnock with scott brown struggling with a calf injury ; like bill gates steve jobs and mark zuckerberg richard murphy started as an entrepreneur by dropping out of college however he did go back

murphy from clongeen co wexford began his university studies with a civil engineering course i dont know what i was thinking i had to get grinds to pass maths in the leaving certificate i lasted five weeks

his careers teacher suggested looking at retail but instead murphy took a quantity surveying course he gained his masters degree and left university in 2009 just as the construction industry collapsed

poor job prospects in ireland led him to move to australia where for the next five years he worked as a quantity surveyor

he became interested in personal fitness while in melbourne working ; who said football is for boys alone aneesha labroo founder of kica  an activewear brand for women  recently announced the launch of kica womens super league in cricketcrazy india where saina nehwal and sania mirza have brought stardust to badminton and tennis she realised that womens soccer was setting the goalpost like never before read the large print the indian women football team has won the saff womens championship four times in a row that too without losing a single game it has also bagged two gold medals at the south asian games in january scottish professional soccer club  rangers womens football club  announced that they have signed up manipur police sports clubs bala devi on an 18month contract women are not just kicking the ball around they are playing ball with a vengeance

kica womens super league comprises six teams and is an amateur football tournament which welcomes girls of all ages skill sets and backgrounds labroo wants to show women that achieving physical fitness can also be fun the best part about this league is that it encourages amateur players we have professional leagues but there are none for amateurs says labroo the enthusiasm for learning a new sport the desire to find new and exciting ways to be and stay active was her motivation behind starting the initiative

in a conversation with ianslife karachiwala who has trained the whos who of bollywood talks if the benefits of pilates its future in the country

q how do you see the future of pilates in india

yasmin i definitely see all of india doing pilates because its such a beautiful form of exercise that works on your awareness your breath your control centering concentration these are all some of the principles of pilates it works on your posture your spine every movement is so precise that it helps you with everything in life and i believe that pilates makes everything else that you do in life better so i just feel that everybody should be doing pilates in india because its such an amazing form of exercise

q whats your expansion plan in the near future

yasmin my future plan is to have one pilates studio in every city of our country im hoping that will happen one day but until then i am on youtube doing pilates exercises every thursday for people to follow in their homes so until we are there in every city im sure people in every city can follow my videos on youtube and get more familiar with the form of exercise

q how different is pilates from the regular gym

yasmin every form of exercise or sport has a different intention as to why it was invented for example martial arts were invented for self defence yoga was invented as a means to be closer to your spiritual self and the gym or weight lifting was invented for building muscle using weights pilates was invented for one reason alone to make the human body move as efficiently as possible if your biceps are stronger than your triceps your arm will not move efficiently if you have a six pack or strong rectus abdominis muscles but weak back muscles you will end up injuring yourself pilates ensures that your entirely body develops long lean muscles evenly throughout the front and back the upper and lower hemispheres so that the body can move as efficiently as possible when your body moves efficiently it saves energy which can be used in other parts of your life pilates literally makes you move better and live better

q top 5 tips and reasons why people should join pilates

yasmin

it is the perfect combination between strength training and stretching

it nonaggressive form of exercise with incredible results

it works on your posture and strengthens your spine and all the muscles around it

it helps to strengthen your core and when your core is strong all other movements in life get easier and better

it forces you to breathe for an hour which makes you feel rejuvenated and refreshed while giving you a great workout

q what is your fitness regime

yasmin i do one hour of pilates a day and 1 hour of cardio everyday sunday is my rest day where i make sure i get a massage

q one common mistake that people make while trying to lose weight

yasmin crash dieting its the worst thing to go an any kind of an extreme diet because i its not sustainable ii your body doesnt get the nutrients that it needs iii higher chances of getting injured and iv really isnt good for your body in the long run

q how important is it for people especially women to understand the importance of being fit rather than thin

yasmin it is extremely important to be fit women run behind being thin and a certain size whereas what is more important is your energy levels during the day and how you are feeling how much you are able to accomplish and how easily you are able to do your daily tasks whats the point of being thin and weak rather be fit and strong ; the band is likely to come with 24x7 heart rate monitoring system

realme entered the indian market two years ago with realme 1 and since then the company has launched several smartphones across price segments but now the company aims to become a tech lifestyle brand and expand its portfolio in other categories for this it has already disclosed its plans to unveil a slew of iot products in 2020 including a first fitness band and a fitness tracker

while the launch date of its fitness tracker is unknown at the moment the fitness band is scheduled to hit the markets on march 5

the company has already given a glimpse of the device on twitter and revealed that it will get a curved display that will sit comfortably on the wrist with a yellow coloured band it will also get seamless connectivity with the realme smartphone

the technical specs of the fitness band are still hiding behind the curtains but since realme has scheduled to unveil the device next month we dont have to wait long enough to know what exactly does it have in store for us

realme ceo madhav sheth in an interview with mobile indian had recently said our philosophy is quite simple we will introduce iot products not just for the sake of it but we will bring such products that help and benefit the users ; republic of ireland manager mick mccarthys played down fears over the fitness of enda stevens ahead of next months euro 2020 playoff with slovakia

the sheffield united fullback was taken off with a calf injury after scoring a wondergoal in their 11 draw with brighton

mccarthy says the substitution was more precautionary than anything and his united manager chris wilder hopes to have stevens back by saturday week

with tongue firmly in cheek the ireland boss says stevens strike at bramall lane improves his goalscoring options for the march 26 game in bratislava ive seen it described as a screamer on one report and thats exactly what it was

enda has been on top form for sheffield united and for ireland all season and its nice to see him amongst the goals now as well

well take goals from anywhere in bratislava at the end of march so the more irish players scoring right now the better as far as im concerned

james mcclean is another hopeful of making that trip to the slovakian capital

his participation in the euro playoff had been placed in serious jeopardy after he sustained a medial knee ligament injury in stokes championship defeat to preston mcclean was ruled out for several weeks by his club

the 30year old winger is in dubai for specialist rehab work and while there he spoke with the dubai reel podcast

mcclean says he was told hed be out for six weeks but he hopes to return in three or four

still wearing a knee brace mcclean told the hosts its a torn mcl and a torn meniscus

they said it was a longstanding tear so ive obviously had it a long time but it wasnt giving me any trouble

they said it would take six weeks so im hoping its three or four ive always been a good healer and im hoping its the case this time around

while goals have been hard to comeby during his tenure mccarthys been buoyed by the returns to form of both shane long and scott hogan

long scored the opener in southamptons 20 win over aston villa while hogan has scored three goals in as many games for birmingham city since his loan move from villa

shane has played himself right back into the reckoning at southampton mccarthy said not because of his two goals in recent weeks but because he is playing week in and week out and showing the benefits of that

scott has really got himself back into the picture for slovakia with his goals for birmingham and his finish on saturday was top class and timely while terry connor was impressed with callum robinsons allround game against bristol city as well as with his lucky header for his second goal in as many games

alan browne used his head as well for his goal we just need them all to keep playing and keep scoring going into march ; planet fitness nyse plnt reported quarterly earnings of 44 cents per share on tuesday which beat the analyst consensus estimate of 41 cents by 732 this is a 2941 increase over earnings of 34 cents per share from the same period last year

thats the good news

the bad news however is you look like shit were sorry to put it so bluntly but after treating several months of seasonal depression with an animalistic diet of pizza beer and other caca cuisine it seems that some of you are headed into summer looking like somebodys unfuckable uncle

but dont despair there is still time to whip that ass into decent shape before the memorial day weekend all you have to do is stop eating like a teenager  so like delete all of those food delivery apps from your phone right now  start exercising like a fiend and maybe think about going a little less leaving las vegas while the sauce has done an admirable job of making the long cold winter months more tolerable for some of us it has also wreaked havoc on our bodies giving us bulging beer guts and man boobs to beat the band were freaking doomed if we dont act fast

still that doesnt mean we have to ditch alcohol altogether to get into fighting shape for boating season

it goes without saying that you need to start drinking a little smarter than youve been doing for the past few months as much as we hate to admit it that probably means putting down the beer for a while that is unless you fully intend to get fitted for your first doubled sports bra this year and perhaps participate in the fat boy review on ladies night down at your local strip club

seriously boys not only does that sissy lowcarb piss water known as light beer bring out the hipsters in droves it can also turn a man into a heaping pile of slobbery admittedly the situation isnt as dire if you happen to be one of those wierdos with the willpower to drink only one or two ever so often but for the real savage drinker were talking about the guy who typically knocks back six or so before he goes out on the town that can mean taking in several hundred empty calories a night

listen were not even trying to say that beer is all bad in fact we would never in addition to being a great source of good times on the drunken wings of our lives some studies have shown that the suds making american burp again also have therapeutic properties no shit researchers from across the globe have found that those eversopopular lagers ales and stouts can provide benefits for our eyes teeth bones heart and immune system hell one study even suggests that beer might help prevent us from getting the diabetes that we are well on our way to if we dont cut some of this godforsaken depression weight granted going on a fullblown beer bender isnt going to do most of us any favors in the long run but lets just say its the thought that counts

now moderate beer consumption might be able to make its way back into your life once the summer season gets underway see thats more good news but for now it might be better to just stick with hard liquor wait wait what a hooch diet yeah although it might sound ridiculous to suggests that demon alcohol like whisky tequila and vodka are more suitable for a man trying not to come out of the gate this year with a fullon dad bod these drinks are actually the smarter choice

not only do they hit harder than beer but they are also seemingly designed with the healthconscious boozehound in mind they are low in carbohydrates and have fewer calories than most brews and while not all carbs are the devil incarnate like some health nuts might have you believe the ones we get through alcohol can be mischievous as allbedamned these little fuckers have a way of infiltrating our systems causing a spike in blood sugar that eventually leads to the creation of fat and while spirits do average around 97 calories per shot they come in at zero carbs ah yes you can almost feel those abs fighting their way to the surface now am i right

at the bar however youve got to be careful all of those highpriced cocktails they are slinging are usually loaded up with insane amounts of sugar these are not at all conducive to the physique of the most doable dude on the lake this summer season we assure you some of these beverages have just as much sugar per serving as sodas and fruit juices avoid them like the plague the better option is to just do a vodka and soda water with a splash of lime not only are you getting the benefit of zero carbs from the booze but there is absolutely no sugar in the mixer

or you could always try our original lowcalorie moscow mule if your snobbish palette requires more flavor

but what about wine well if you are one of those hoitytoity dudes that gets his kicks from the likes of cabernet sauvignon riesling and merlot youre still in better shape than the average beer drinker sure these beverages can have more than 100 calories per glass but they are more merciful when it comes to carbs what about a chardonnay get the fuck out of here with that noise

look all of this healthier drinking crap really just depends on the individual some of you lucky bastards can drink beer all day long and never gain a pound while others myself included seem to pack it on just by hanging around the craft beer section a little longer than usual it is essential to find what works for you and sweet whimpering christ on a sharp stick dont make yourself miserable in the process its not worth it sure we want to look our very best when we venture out this summer for all of the legendary times that are sure to be had but lets face it a day not lived is one that is undoubtedly wasted i cant remember who said that but they are wise words nonetheless and sometimes living means sucking back a 12pack of your favorite brew and devouring a whole pizza in front of the television its the little things you know there is always time to make smarter decisions regarding your health just keep in mind that no matter how much of a gnarly beast you become there will always be someone out there willing to pork you and im telling you boys that right there is what helps me sleep at night ; make the most of your workout with top fitness accessories

and sunsport reported that it was touch and go whether he would be ready to return by the time city travelled to the bernabeu

while he did not the travelling party for the win at leicester on saturday he has been training for the last few days

and it seems certain that sterling will be on the plane when the squad fly to spain early on tuesday afternoon

that will leave pep guardiola with a big decision on whether to pick him from the start or name him among the substitutes

sterling is certain to want to play and catch the eye having confirmed at the weekend that he would love to play for the spanish giants one day

while madrid boss zinedine zidane also refused to rule out a summer move for very good sterling earlier this week

because it coincided with citys winter break the injury kept him out of just two matches and he is likely to be fresh to face zidanes men ; shang x li y xu h zhang q liu a ma g the clustering of low diet quality low physical fitness and unhealthy sleep pattern and its association with changes in cardiometabolic risk factors in children nutrients 2020 122591

in a candid interview with hindustan times celebrity trainer yasmin karachiwala spilled the secrets about celebrities toned figures and their fitness mantra the gym instructor talked about the formula all soughtafter bollywood divas follow to stay in shape

speaking of the worlds ultimate source of motivation deepika padukone who is always seen laboring hard during her workout sessions yasmin said the secret is her commitment to fitness and her dedication she knows that working out makes her feel really good whether its 7 in the morning or sometimes even 6 or 5 am she makes sure that she gets a good workout before she heads for a shoot

talking about the fitness queen katrina kaif she further said katrina is very hardworking and fitness is really important for her no matter how packed her day is she finds that one hour for workout even if she has to do it between meetings or shoots she takes out that one hour and focuses on fitness to a great extent

yasmin further stated how alia bhatts tough schedule has been an obstacle in her steady workout sessions alia does a lot of pilates with me but since the last six months she has been very busy with all the different movies that shes been shooting for she used to be very regular but now we do pilates whenever she gets time

upon being inquired about who is the fittest actor in bollywood the trainer crowned akshay kumar saying akshay kumar is definitely the fittest man in bollywood talking about women all of them are great

advising the fans who aspire to look like their favorite celebrities she urged i believe each persons body is unique to themselves and each body type is very different from the other what i always tell my clients is look at the body you have and try to make it the best that you can get look at others for motivation but its not like a person who is 52 can look like deepika padukone her body is longer her muscles are longer her limbs are longer you can look better in your own body each of us needs to accept our body and work on making that the best ; a fitbitstyle health tracker for pets has been invented by british boffins

owners may soon be able to track their pets health by monitoring their heart and breathing with the new device

the tech created at imperial college london provides a new way to measure vital signs without direct skin contact

the sensor which can measure through fur and fabric could also help vets monitor animals during surgery without the need for shaving them

study chief dr firat guder said wearables are expected to play a major role in monitoring health and detecting diseases early

our stretchy flexible invention heralds a whole new type of sensor that can track the health of animals and humans alike over fur or clothing

the device is made from a silicone material that tightly moulds to the fur clothing or body part it is placed on

a builtin microphone picks up sound waves  like a stethoscope  which are transmitted to a computer

colleague yasin cotur said the sensor works like a watery stethoscope filling any gaps between it and its subject so that no air bubbles get in and dampen the sound

researchers believe the technology could allow pet owners to track their animals in real time with integrated motion sensors allowing them to watch movements through a smartphone app

it would show live where their pets are and whether they are standing sitting or lying down

the technology could even help improve the work of sniffer dogs detecting bombs and missing persons

they are trained to sit or bark when they detect a target object like an explosive device or person stuck in rubble after an earthquake

when dogs alert to target objects their heart and breathing rates increase because they are excited to be rewarded

researchers say the new sensor could help measure alerting behaviour by measuring how excited the dogs are

an inbuilt algorithm might be able to tell the strength of the dogs reaction to the smell it detects and even work out how sure it is of finding the desired object

the sensors have so far been tested on dogs and humans

mr cotur said the next step is to validate our system further with animals primarily focusing on sniffer dogs and then horses and livestock later on

the research was published in the journal advanced functional materials ; wyze best known for its inexpensive cameras and smart home gadgets and an unfortunate server breach last year is planning several new products for 2020 including the wyze band part fitness tracker part smart home controller the wyze band will have builtin alexa capabilities according to a blog post from the company dave zatz gave some deeper insights on zatznotfunny with details gleaned from a federal communications commission filing and a publicly available beta app via engadget

rogers remarked that the plan and how it was announced was obviously disturbing to the community

he advised that he was particularly concerned because the center for domestic preparedness which im very familiar with is not equipped for handling people with infectious diseases

its a training facility for first responders around the country who basically stay in barracks and hotel rooms while theyre training out there rogers stated so it does not have the capacity to deal with infectious disease control nor does our local hospital or local emergency personnel

he outlined that he first called the president on saturday to inform him of the situation and explain why the cdp was not a suitable site

he had no idea rogers said of the presidents knowledge of the hhs plan at that time he was angry that theyd even brought them back to the continental united states from japan when nobody had asked him  he did not give his consent for it

but nonetheless he did not want them being brought to alabama to that facility he continued

rogers said trump called him twice more on sunday including after the hhs secretary called rogers to say the plan had been cancelled the hhs secretary reportedly told rogers that the president had pulled the plug on the plan

i really appreciate them acting so quickly particularly president trump because we were really not equipped in this community to deal at the center for domestic preparedness with this virus we know it is a very dangerous virus its spreading in ways that were not familiar with particularly what its doing in china rogers noted it did not need to be in our communities where we dont have the facilities for it

the congressman pledged to stay vigilant and ensure the plan remains cancelled he said he would be on it like white on rice

i know theres been a lot of anxiety in and around this community  and folks should know that its not going to happen rogers emphasized

he did also specifically take issue with the hhs only notifying the governors office about the plan and then issuing a press release before contacting local officials rogers said he was informed not by the hhs but by the governors office on saturday morning

hhs really handled this very poorly rogers stressed before they ever sent any press release they should have at a minimum contacted the local elected leadership  and the hospital and the first responders to make sure they were prepared and that we had the facilities to deal with it nobody did that they issued a press release saying they were bringing them in before they talked to anybody and the president when he talked to me sunday afternoon he told me that there may be some people who lose their jobs over the way this was handled but the good news is that it has been handled and theyre not going to come here but it was a secondrate operation by whoever at hhs tried to pull this off

listen ; sunday feb 17 healthday news  several oftencited fitness facts are really myths according to experts on exercise

for example stretching before exercise doesnt actually reduce the risk of injury the american council on exercise ace said in a feb 14 news release after examining research conducted over the past decade however stretching can help prevent injuries at other times such as after a workout

static stretching where you extend a muscle group to its maximum and hold it for up to 30 seconds  for example a static leg stretch  doesnt boost exercise performance ace cautioned on the contrary static stretching before a workout can have a negative effect on explosive activities such as sprinting and jumping and on maximal strength production

instead ace recommended including some dynamic stretches in a warmup routine one example of dynamic stretching would be a sprinter doing long exaggerated strides to prepare for a race according to the ace website

running is actually better than walking for those who want to burn more calories although walking is a great physical activity the experts stressed running requires 40 percent more energy

finally lactic acid doesnt really cause acidosis and muscle fatigue during exercise this myth has commonly been viewed as fact due to the misinterpretation of research the group said that lactate is helpful during highintensity exercise ; lauren simpson showed off her shredded physique to her 18 million instagram followers on monday february 24 taking to the popular social media app to post a sweltering snapshot from a previous trip to southeast asia

according to running usa more than 18 million people registered for races in 2017 with 5ks  the most popular distance  featuring more than 88 million of those runners a standardized distance in running five kilometers 5k equals 31 miles

with entry fees averaging 34 per a report from the new york times but costs only totaling 2750 for advertising tshirts timing services insurance etc per runner as long as a race host could draw in 200 runners they could make a profit of 1300 without sponsors

some farms have already trotted down this path read more about their experiences below

fishkill fitness

consider fishkill farms a 270acre orchard and vegetable farm in east fishkill ny we had been thinking about how it would be fun to host a 5k race but didnt have the time or resources to do so by ourselves in the midst of our upick operation explained katie ross one day a member of our local rotary club came in and asked if we could collaborate on hosting a 5k event it was quite serendipitous

the rotary club was new to planning races and sought out the farm because they wanted to host it somewhere local roads didnt need to be shut down fishkill farms provided the space marketing support course mowing assistance planning  and donuts the rotary club was in charge of the ticketing website race tshirts soliciting sponsorships print marketing course signage and hiring an ambulance and a dj so the two entities split the upfront costs

ross said the farm has continued to host the race because they had so much fun doing so the first time both organizations worked together well she said weve increased our turnout and the event is of benefit to the fishkill rotary who do a lot to support our community together they are planning to host the race for a third year this july

because it is a upick farm fishkill farms already has the infrastructure and proper insurance to accept customers onto their property

diane millers legacy

diane miller married david miller and together they worked on his familys miller plant farm in york pa opening the miller plant farm garden center in 2011 in february 2015 diane was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer while undergoing treatment she learned about wellspans york cancer patient help fund which gives 100 of the money donated directly to local patients to help meet their immediate needs miller plant farm hosted its first cancer care day 2017 raising 6000 for the fund

sadly diane lost her battle in june 2018 but last year the diane miller gift of hope fund was established raising nearly 24000 for local patients during that years summer bash which includes a race

on aug 1 the farm will be hosting its fourth annual summer bash featuring the farm fresh 5k in 2019 their race had more than 200 runners registered

a friendraiser at lundale

lundale farm started hosting its pottstown pa 5k in 2014 since 2017 it has been an annual event the goal for our 5k is to invite runners to enjoy our beautiful farm that is not normally open to the public said jodi gauker lundale farms executive director

our farm is a great place to host because we have a gravel road the runs through the property and then beautiful fields that we can run through and around as well it really shows off the assets of the property from the vast pastures to the rolling hillsides the farm road runs along the french creek in places and livestock line the lane as well cows pigs and chickens she added

consisting of 520 acres those at lundale farms view the run mostly as a friendraiser instead of a fundraiser according to gauker she said sponsorship from local businesses support race expenses like portable toilet rentals the fees for the timing system food and drinks the runner fees really just cover the cost of their shirt and a little extra for other expenses the goal is really to meet people who enjoy farmland and locally produced foods so they can see the work that were doing she explained

of course the course matters

fishkill farms in downstate new york features rolling hills providing a challenging course for those who run it along with plenty of oldgrowth apple trees to provide shade and amazing views of the hudson valley according to the farms katie ross

the farm fresh 5k hosted by miller plant farm is an allterrain run that takes participants through the fields of the farm hosting the public to our farm for this event allows our community to see portions of our land which are otherwise private and not publically accessible noted christy miller

the race course at lundale farms has evolved over the years at first it included a loop on their horseshoe trail a public trail that runs through the property and then onto their farm road starting and finishing at a nearby school they eventually discovered they could fit the entire course on the farm completely so they do that now including a loop around neighboring kneehigh farms vegetable fields unlike most runs which take place in the morning lundale farms event is a twilight run just before sunset

the bottom line benefits

every farm country folks spoke to about the benefits of hosting a race mentioned the exposure to a new segment of the population in the case of fishkill farms promotion done by their rotary club partners helps raise awareness about the work they do and brings people to the farm to see it themselves

we would recommend other farms host an event like this if they have the capacity to do so said katie ross as local farmers we try to be involved in our community as much as possible our neighbors support us and we support them too

christy miller of miller plant farm agreed i would absolutely recommend other farms hosting events such as a trail run having a benefit for the event always makes it more personal and more purposeful this also makes it very personal for our family she said ultimately its so wonderful to see our community come together for such a wonderful cause

owls boss garry monk suggested fletcher would be included on the bench for wednesday evenings clash despite not being fully fit at all with foxs involvement to be decided on his recovery from those 45 minutes in the midlands

but the manager reported less positive news on the condition of injured trio adam reach massimo luongo and moses odubajo who will miss out with toe calf and hamstring injuries respectively

asked whether any of them would feature in the clash monk said it doesnt look likely massimo still has another week or so adam is going ok but wont be available this week

mo probably not this week and even morgan and fletch theyre not fully fit

steven has trained for three days morgan has only trained one day but its a case of needs must and the leadership side of it with those two especially

hopefully birmingham will have done them good well keep building

wednesday face derby county at hillsborough following the charlton clash hoping to end a run of home form that has seen them fail to score at home this year

owls boss monk has reiterated the importance of improving their home form ; of the many whom i have trained i take great pride in declaring that i found real joy in training the ones who had lost hopes of ever reviving back their much cherished vitality and youth to the many more on whom the doors of opportunity and a second chance to be their fittest have shut down or as they assume to be so i would like to quote napoleon hill who said who said it could not be done and what great victories has he to his credit which qualify him to judge others accuratelybe honest devoid of others opinions about you reason out honestly why do you want to weight train be explicit spell it out boldly and live it

the most important fact in this regard is ones body posture perhaps the most underestimated aspect of conditioning every one before beginning to train should examine himselfherself in front of a mirror the feet should be evenly balanced

the ankles should be even without the knees being too close or too far apart bilateral portions of the body should be on an even keel with each other such as the hips ears and eyes the shoulders should be thicker than the chest and the chest much thicker than the midsection

the entire body primarily works on the principle of balance similar to any architectural splendour hence its efficiency is directly proportional an illustration in this regard would suffice it all if the persons abdomen muscles are weak the muscles of the back tighten themselves compensatory

this results in postural changes creating a sway back or backward weight bearingleansimilarly if the abdominal muscles are tight and the trunk compensates by leaning forward the back muscles become weak and the posture assumes a forward lean the shoulders droop the neck and head stick out and multiple symptoms result

weight training then becomes the only hope and a result oriented one at that a training device to correct these structural imbalances experience wisdom and research on human dynamics have proven that improper muscular balance that has accrued due to lifestyle habits amongst the agonist antagonistic muscles through properly guided programs of resistance training can be revived completely

by applying different exercising programs an imbalanced muscle groups can be reinstated to their proper dynamics and the resultant efficiency greatly magnified not only does it improve an aspiring sportsmans performance but it holds true equally for a person interested in good health

misdirected enthusiasm is at the root cause of so many fitness pursuits what a shame so few learn this lesson of those who learn this lesson they often take so long to learn that they lose many of their most productive years ; planet fitness nyse plnt will be releasing its next round of earnings this tuesday february 25 for all of the relevant information here is your guide for tuesdays q4 earnings announcement

the fitness trainers latest set of instructional videos were shared to her page on monday and included a complete postural routine for her fans to try while introducing the workout routine to her audience kayla noted that the set of exercises could particularly be helpful to people that spend most of their workday sitting at a desk as well as new mothers looking to rebuild their strength she also explained that it was quick and simple as the entire circuit only took about 10 minutes and could be performed with only three pieces of equipment  a foam roller an exercise mat and a resistance band

kayla rocked a light blue sports bra black running shorts and a pair of white sneakers to demonstrate the stretching exercises she kicked off the video by performing an upper back stretch utilizing her foam roller she placed the roller underneath her upper back and laid on top of it in a situp position she lifted her core area off the ground and slowly began rolling up and down from her lower neck to the middle of her back

kayla used a bright pink resistance band for the next exercise which was intended to stretch out the pectoral area she held one end of the band behind her back and grasped the other end from over her head before pulling it up toward the ceiling  a position she held for approximately 20 seconds next up were shoulder rotations which saw her grip the resistance band with both hands and rotate from in front of her chest to behind her back

the next exercise in the postural routine was a set of face pulls for this move kayla looped her resistance band around her feet which were stretched out in front of her  and pulled her arms back toward her head to stretch her shoulders and back she followed these up with a set of external rotations for which she held the band with a supinated grip in front of her torso and rotated her arms out while keeping her elbows bent at a 90degree angle

the final exercise in the routine was set of bentover rows also utilizing the resistance band kayla stepped on the elastic band with her feet shoulder length apart and bend over at her hips keeping her back straight she pulled the resistance band back by bringing her shoulder blades close together before releasing back into the starting position

whats more he told analysts while discussing the companys q4 results nautilus has a difficult hill to climb not only is peloton interactive inc a fierce competitor but its also a foe with different goals than most publicly traded companies

peloton which only held its ipo last fall has been operating at a loss and projects to do so until 2023 when it finally expects to turn a profit despite nautilus best efforts its hard to keep pace with a company that measures success in such a fundamentally different way

we missed early connectedfitness trends and despite recent acceleration are continuing to catch up barr said we are facing strong competition some of which do not seem to have a profit motive at least in the short run therefore it is not reasonable to expect that our turnaround and full transformation is going to be a shortterm exercise

despite being late to join the connectedfitness category nautilus has shifted into high gear and is spinning furiously to gain ground on leaders like peloton echelon and others barr said that includes some new offerings in its product portfolio and the launch of nautilus digital platform under the jrny brand

the company has newfound energy centered on a comprehensive business transformation as well as the appointment of barr as ceo in late july his arrival came about five months after the resignation of nautilus previous ceo bruce cazenave and a steady stream of slumping sales and sagging profits

in my first few months here the team and i have identified key issues diagnosed root causes put in place shortterm actions focused on execution in the fitness season and delivered sequential improvements at the most important time of the year barr said

so far so good on the companys efforts to start reinventing itself in light of such trends as connected fitness and such competitors as peloton

on both our products and in our gotomarket methods we are becoming a more digital version of our former selves barr said we have a talented and evolving team and a culture that is strong resilient and not resistant to change with technology and connectedness we have more ways to deliver on our noble mission

nautilus made some important strides while pursuing that noble mission in the fourth quarter the first full quarter with barr at the helm

nautilus reported earnings per share for the fourth quarter of 12 cents easily topping wall streets estimates by 26 cents revenue of 1042 million was down 97 percent compared to the yearago quarter but it topped expectations by 44 million

in the fourth quarter we achieved sequential improvements in important areas which we believe are reflective of disciplined execution and the initial strategic initiatives we began to implement during the second half of 2019 barr said even though we are encouraged by these shortterm results we must be realistic that we still face considerable challenges we are fighting to reverse a multiyear revenue and profitability decline that culminated with losing more than 20 percent of our revenue base in 2019 driven largely by the decline in the max line

in the companys direct segment net sales were 359 million down 281 percent from 499 million increased sales of bowflex bikes and max total were more than offset by lower max trainerproduct sales

gross margin in the direct segment was 499 percent down from 587 percent driven by unfavorable product mix and unfavorable overhead absorption related to the decrease in sales the company said

nautilus reported an operating loss of 5 million in the direct segment up from an operating loss of 38 million in the yearago quarter due primarily to reflected lower net sales and lower gross margin rates partially offset by reductions in sales and marketing expenses

the company did optimize its fitnessseason advertising spend and focused on higherreturning media which resulted in a 427 percent reduction in advertising expenses

said barr among the multiple causes of directs multiyear decline which accelerated in 2018 and 2019 that we have diagnosed and begun to address one losing track of customers evolving purchase journey and media consumption habits two repeating a similar unsuccessful media mix strategy for several years three failing to introduce connected fitness and technology to our products rapidly enough four not keeping up with modern marketing techniques and five gaps in leadership we expect to make progress on these and other fronts to revitalize the channel however it is unclear when this channel will return to profitable growth

nautilus notched more favorable results in its retail segment the company reported net sales of 675 million a 48 percent increase from 644 million in q4 2018 higher sales were driven primarily by selecttech weights and schwinn ic bikes as well as thirdquarter 2019 shipment delays that were recognized in the fourth quarter of 2019

retail gross margin was 288 percent down from 317 percent driven primarily by unfavorable sales mix and higher tariffs and the segments operating income was 122 million up 81 percent from 113 million lower gross margin dollars were more than offset by more efficient sales and marketing expenses as well as reduced research and development costs

barr closed his remarks by saying the company is laserfocused on improving its direct segment and then outlined some of the moves nautilus has made in recent months from the heightened emphasis on connected to fitness to bolstering its leadership team

all told those actions have the company bullish on the path forward although nautilus didnt release guidance due to the timing of the fourth quarter 2019 release and the early stages of its business transformation it did provide the following commentary the company expects ebitda from continuing operations to be a loss in the range of 4 million to 1 million capital expenditures for 2020 are anticipated to be in the range of 8 million to 10 million

we are pleased with our change in trajectory and shortterm results our strengthened balance sheet further acceleration of connected fitness and improvements in the team barr said in closing we continue to have much work to do but i am pleased and excited that we have begun to move forward ; yanita yanchevas most recent instagram share shows the model nearly baring it all for the camera in an insanely sexy topless shot the blond bombshell regularly flaunts her fantastic figure for fans in a variety of different sexy outfits but her last swimsuitclad shot came a week ago with a photo of the model posing in a sexy black suit from alt swim yesterday yancheva delighted her fans once again in another scandalous and revealing swimsuit shot this time wearing only bikini bottoms

the 29yearold has made just 13 appearances so far this season in what is his debut campaign with the spanish giants with injuries keeping him sidelined as hes missed 17 games in total as a result

see more chelsea star angry with frank lampard and eager for highly ambitious transfer

his last appearance was back in november and so zinedine zidane will be hoping that the belgian international is able to return sooner rather than later to hand his side a timely boost heading into the business end of the year

according to as real madrid could get their wish on thursday as its suggested that hazard is expected to be named in the squad for their encounter with sociedad in the cup

its added that the decision was taken to avoid risking him in the derby against atletico madrid at the weekend and so this could be an ideal opportunity to gradually ease him back into the mix as he has now had three sessions with the rest of the group in training with no setbacks

the fact that real madrid have coped so well without their marquee signing from last summer is a real credit to zidane and the rest of his squad as theyve lifted the spanish supercopa and hold an advantage in the la liga title race

further theyre still in the hunt for a domestic cup and the champions league and so to be able to add hazard to the group now while hes fresh and raring to go could be a decisive moment in their campaign

time will tell though firstly whether or not the belgian does get a chance of a run out this week and whether or not he can come through that with no issues to prove that hes ready to edge ever closer to a full comeback ; los angeles kim kardashian seems to be little more cautious about her health and fitness as she makes more efforts to live a healthy life

jose mourinho has named the day he expects harry kane to make his comeback from injury  and it is better late than never for england

kane has flown to barbados for warmweather treatment after the hamstring operation which threatened to make him a serious doubt to captain england at euro 2020 this summer

but tottenham manager mourinho has allayed fears his top scorer would not play again this season by revealing he is on schedule for spurs last two premier league games in may

that would give kane more than a month to regain full throttle before the three lions european championship opener against croatia on june 14

initially spurs prognosis was a return to action in april but there had been more cautious smoke signals since about him not playing again in the 201920 campaign until mourinhos latest bulletin

asked when he thought kane might wear the lilywhite shirt again he replied the leicester match on may 9

maybe we need that match for something  to be fourth to be fifth to be sixth and maybe he can help us achieve it i hope so is that the best case scenario yes i think so

there is not a setback nothing has happened everything is ok hes having treatment theres no pressure he keeps going thats just my feeling

with hugo lloris we were speaking about him playing again in february and he came back in january its better not to put any kind of expectations any kind of pressure on let it go and lets see

kane finished last season with a race against time to recover from an ankle injury ahead of the champions league final defeat by liverpool 

he looked short of a gallop in madrid but mourinho insists he has not yet considered the possible effects of kanes return if a topfour finish or a trophy was at stake

three lions boss gareth southgate would face a similar dilemma if kane reported fit for euro 2020 but short of match practice

however mourinho shrugged thats a problem for southgate and steve holland not for me

mourinho will put out a strong side against southampton on wednesday night but does not accept the cup is spurs likeliest route back to europe next season

he added to win the fa cup is very difficult you have all the top opponents and good teams with dreams like southampton and sheffield united its very difficult ; cuneyt dil

contes side eventually went on to win the game thanks to a romelu lukaku brace but the italian manager hinted later on that that eriksens fitness levels could have been the reason behind the early substitution

i think that for someone who arrived five days ago and we should not forget we had to rush him in because we were missing several midfielders eriksen still made a positive impact he said

obviously he needs to get settled into our style of football and also find the right fitness levels for serie a but i am very pleased with his full debut

eriksen moved to inter milan in january in a move reportedly worth 20 million with the alternative for spurs being that he walked out as a free agent at the end of the season

the dont quit campaign works with governors offices to award and build fitness facilities in schools around the country its a partnership with the governors offices and the national foundation for governors fitness councils

the application process opened monday the dont quit campaign will award three elementary or middle schools in indiana with a new fitness facility for students teachers and the entire community

jake steinfeld chairman of the national foundation of governors fitness councils said we ask the school to keep the fitness center open before and after school and on weekends so not just for the kids and the teachers but for moms and dads grandmas and grandpas aunts and uncles

steinfeld says the purpose of this campaign is about building confidence at a young age this is not a democrat or republican issue this is a kids issue

funding for this project comes from public and private partnerships the foundation has put more than 100 gyms in schools in 32 states and steinfeld says each of them is different

it could be in an old lunch room it could be in an old classroom it could be in a classroom that hasnt been used in a long time and they break down a wall and it becomes one big room steinfeld said

steinfeld says school or city size doesnt matter when it comes to picking the winner he says it is about the community to enter community members need to make a video on a phone and explain why the school deserves this facility deadline is march 20

alyssa perry who has a child living with her reacted to the campaign little kids tend to have a lot of energy and that is where a lot of habits tend to develop when you are younger

in my mind i feel like maybe the older schools would benefit from it more just because i know the 7yearold that lives with me would not use half of that equipment perry said

the popstar stays motivated by frequently working out with her boyfriend

she also makes sure she starts the day in the gym to ensure she has enough energy to keep her going

while filming hustlers jennifer also mastered the art of poledancing

during that time jennifer worked out intensively to build the upper body and core strength she needed to support herself on the pole

she said it was more like the more you can work on the pole the more youre going to tone the things that need to be toned anyway and youre getting the work done for the movie

when jennifer isnt working out in the gym or dancing she goes to celebrity trainer david kirsch in new york for a more high intensity session

instead of conventional cardio the trainer to the stars prefers his clients to do highintensity interval training

these can involve anything from kickboxing circuit training burpees and lunges  and this particular kind of high intensity training in short bursts has been proven to to increase fitness level and regulate blood sugar which helps you stay trim as you age

jlo keeps her skin looking so young and flawless with regular facials and never being caught outside without wearing sunscreen

the singer told instyle that because she wears a lot of makeup when performing she chooses not to wear any in her downtime to let her skin rest

alli was on the receiving end of a rash challenge from raheem sterling during the north london sides 20 win over manchester city on sunday the city forward was only shown a yellow card and while alli continued he was eventually substituted in the 70th minute

mourinho has now revealed that the injury he sustained was not as bad as first feared moreover there is a chance that he could even feature against southampton

not as bad as we thought so there is a chance there is a chance of him playing tomorrow so wait and see but there is a chance mourinho said as quoted by the daily mail

it is just a question of being a little bit lucky or unlucky you need a little bit of luck dele alli was very lucky did sterling want to injure him i dont think so i dont believe that he wanted to

so respect to sterling i have no problem at all but the intention does not count what counts is the action it is a red card

sterlings tackle was checked by var but it was deemed to be worthy of only a yellow not a red the former chelsea and manchester united boss was once again keen to share his thoughts claiming that it should not be called var if the referee is not allowed to check the pitchside monitor

the only thing i can say is if the referees are not allowed to go to the pitchside screen and take the big decisions of the game they have to change the name of the var and call it vr  video referee

elsewhere the 57yearold has revealed that ben davies has returned to training following an ankle injury he sustained in november with the spurs boss hopeful he will be fit to face aston villa on february 16

hes training with us since monday of course after wednesday the boys are going to have some time off but not him he has to stay and work

champions league

victor is in a position where we have lots of players  harry winks eric dier oliver skipp and gedson fernandes ; jose mourinho has cast doubt on harry kanes chances of being match fit for euro 2020 by suggesting the bestcase scenario for the england captain is a return in tottenhams penultimate premier league game of the season against leicester on may 9

that would likely leave kane who had surgery on a ruptured hamstring tendon last month with just two spurs fixtures and 36 days to get up to speed before the three lions opening match against croatia at wembley on june 14

despite the clubs initial prognosis that kane would return to training in april mourinho has already suggested he could miss the euros entirely with gareth southgate due to name his squad on june 2

kane who was injured at southampton on new years day last week published a video of himself doing hamstring strengthening exercises and has travelled to the caribbean for warm weather training to aid his recovery fuelling optimism about his progress

but ahead of spurs return to st marys for wednesdays fa cup fourthround replay mourinho was downbeat on his vicecaptains chances of featuring before leicesters visit

the leicester match on may 9 he said maybe we need that match for something  to be fourth to be fifth to be sixth maybe we need that match for something and maybe he can help us in this match i hope

asked if that was kanes bestcase scenario the spurs manager said yes i think so

leicester is the beginning of may the first week of may  there is not a setback he added nothing has happened everything is ok hes having his treatment theres no pressure he keeps going no setback i just think thats my feeling

with hugo lloris we were speaking about february and he came back in january its better not to put any kind of expectations any kind of pressure let it go and lets see

spurs will finish the season at crystal palace on may 17 unless they reach the fa cup final scheduled for may 18 or a second consecutive champions league final on may 30

kane will definitely miss englands friendlies against italy and denmark in march but mourinhos timeline could see him build precious match fitness in the warmup matches in austria on june 2 and against romania five days later

with so little gametime potentially available kanes readiness to lead england at the euros will surely be the subject of debate particularly given he has typically taken time to return to his best after injury

thats a problem for southgate and for steve holland not for me said mourinho i dont know how i would feel if i was england manager im not

in 201718 kane returned from a second ankle injury of the campaign at the start of april in more than enough time to be fit for 2018 world cup but he was not at his explosive best in russia despite finishing with the golden boot

last season he missed nine matches at the end of campaign after again suffering ankle ligament damage but controversially returned and started the champions league final defeat to liverpool in place of semifinal hattrick hero lucas moura

asked if he would be prepared to throw kane straight back info his xi when the time comes mourinho said i have no idea what is going to happen ; postnatal development of the human gut microbiota is linked to healthy growth because the number of potential interactions between community components is vast an unanswered question is what mechanisms determine the form of community assembly succession we created a simplified manipulable in vivo model where bacterial strains cultured from an infant were divided into consortia representing earlier and later periods in assembly and introduced in different order into germfree mice fed infant formula measuring strain abundances bacterial gene expression and levels of gut nutrients and applying computational tools to deduce interacting features we identify genomic and metabolic correlates of how strains establish and maintain themselves this approach may facilitate discoveries of how communities respond to various perturbations and microbiotadirected therapeutics

human gut microbiota development has been associated with healthy growth but understanding the determinants of community assembly and composition is a formidable challenge we cultured bacteria from serially collected fecal samples from a healthy infant 34 sequenced strains containing 103102 genes were divided into two consortia representing earlier and later stages in community assembly during the first six postnatal months the two consortia were introduced alone singly or sequentially in different order or simultaneously into young germfree mice fed human infant formula the pattern of fitness of bacterial strains observed across the different colonization conditions indicated that laterphase strains substantially outcompete earlierphase strains although four earlyphase members persist persistence was not determined by order of introduction suggesting that priority effects are not prominent in this model to characterize succession in the context of the metabolic potential of consortium members we performed in silico reconstructions of metabolic pathways involved in carbohydrate utilization and amino acid and bvitamin biosynthesis then quantified the fitness abundance of strains in serially collected fecal samples and their transcriptional responses to different histories of colonization applying featurereduction methods disclosed a set of metabolic pathways whose presence andor expression correlates with strain fitness and that enable earlystage colonizers to survive during introduction of later colonizers the approach described can be used to test the magnitude of the contribution of identified metabolic pathways to fitness in different community contexts study various ecological processes thought to govern community assembly and facilitate development of microbiotadirected therapeutics ; most of the garmin watch range is now definitely cheaper than before including the new vivoactive 44s fenix 6 series and more

in the runup to the las vegas democratic presidential primary faceoff vermont sen bernie sanders national press secretary briahna joy gray told cnn that opponents are trying to use his october heart attack against him then she mistakenly claimed that mike bloomberg has suffered heart attacks in the past  a statement she quickly walked back after a bloomberg adviser said in a tweet it was a trumpy lie

he did not have a heart attack bloombergs camp explained trying to differentiate its candidates health status he had stents the former new york mayor according to the campaign had coronary stents inserted two decades ago after a cardiac test indicated they might be useful

feathers still ruffled the two candidates went at it again on the debate stage

i think the one area maybe that mayor bloomberg and i share you have two stents as well sanders said thursday to his rival onstage

bloomberg responded twentyfive years ago

its not surprising with the oldest crop ever of presidential candidates that their vital signs are becoming a talking point

when it comes to politics personal health is just one more issue to try and leverage said arthur caplan a professor of bioethics at nyu school of medicine in new york city

that got us wondering how this information fits into the facts voters weigh and in evaluating a candidates longterm health or electability does it really matter whether a patient got a stent as part of treatment for a heart attack like sanders or for another reason such as to relieve chest pain or following a cardiac stress test like bloomberg

in this day and age with the way technology has advanced and the skill sets of the cardiologists i would say they are practically the same we expect good results for both said dr hadley wilson a practicing cardiologist in charlotte nc and a member of the american college of cardiologys board of trustees ; global wearable fitness products market 2019  industry scenario strategies growth factors and forecast 2025

a woman who has battled breast cancer and still ran marathons throughout is calling on other fitness fundraisers this february to help a charity close to her heart

caroline allkins ran the london marathon a year later than expected following a diagnosis of breast cancer

caroline took to the capitals streets just months after having a mastectomy following rigorous chemotherapy radiotherapy and a breast reconstruction

caroline 47 ran nearly all the way through from diagnosis including completing the liverpool half marathon and wirral half marathon respectively

in london caroline ran the race of her life on behalf of dsn a north west england and north east walesbase charity which supports people with a sensory loss

caroline who has been an interpreter with dsn for more than 25 years said whilst i was a runner before my diagnosis even at my weakest during treatment i still managed to find the strength to run so if i can do it anyone can

everyone knows that the hardest part is day one  putting on those trainers and taking that step onto the pavement for the first time once that hurdle is out of the way its about building up your confidence and your stamina and everything else will fall into place

a range of races are being held throughout the north west and north wales during 2020 including the essar chester half marathon in may mbna chester marathon in october liverpool rockn roll marathon  half marathon in may and aldi chester 10k in march

signing up is the easy part and training can be so much fun said mumoftwo caroline

unlike many of the larger charities dsn very rarely gets chosen as a charity to run for and we want to change that as we do so much good work in the community we operate so many projects that could really be helped with a funding boost from someone who is running any of these races

amongst the schemes is youth vibe  a social inclusion group held weekly for young people with a profound or severe hearing loss codas children of deaf adults and their friends funds also go to help boost projects that reach out to older people with a hearing loss and memory loss too namely you me and tea the dementia cafe

dsn works with people from birth right through to death  and by that we are even are asked to help fund bsl interpreters at funerals

any money raised goes straight to help those with a hearing or sight loss to be more included better supported and assisted at the point of need for free

we hope that by people pledging to take part in these great feats for themselves that they feel good helping others and pledge to help dsn too

zareen specializes in postpregnancy weight loss and fitness too besides she is also a motivational coach and regularly interacts with women encouraging them to make exercise a part of their daily lives this she insists can be achieved by making small changes in diet  lifestyle it is no surprise that zareens work also makes her a motivational coach to her clients after all it requires a lot of selfcontrol and motivation to stay on the path of tough functional training and zareen realizes how important it is to keep bucking up her clients through their daily rigors

as for the aspiring young men and women who want to build a career out of fitness and nutrition coaching zareen has this to say there are many good reputed institutes in india and outside offering courses it is always advisable to educate yourself in the field that you want to work in and of course at the end of the day its your work and your talents which combines you for a ride to longterm financial commercial journey ; something strange is happening to the fitness industry or maybe it already happened  years ago  and im only just noticing now having no social media presence can be a mixed blessing theres a shift in how fitness is being packaged and sold a shift that emphasizes an almost slavelike devotion to the self during my lifetime the act of working out was usually presented as democratic in nature a basic right accessible to all now its being rebranded as a sort of mandatory luxury item for this generation of digital nomads

hell even the language has changed health is wellness exercising is training getting a massage is selfcare forgive me for coming off as a younger andy rooney but back in my day youd hit the gym a few times a week either before or after work and that was that maybe youd play some ball with buddies on the weekend maybe run an easy 5k sunday mornings food mattered but it wasnt something to stress over

today the expectation is to be up at 4 am for morning meditation and journaling while riding out the final wave of your 12hour daily fast breakfast  and every morsel that passes your lips thereafter  is posted on instagram for the approval of the ohso legitimate dietitians trainers and food scientists who lurk in the comments section your workout is no longer just that its an experience to be shared with your tribeteampod one that we must pause and express gratitude for whenever possible quick grab your journal

by now youre likely wondering what my point is hasnt the pursuit of physical perfection and ultimate longevity always been just a tad selfindulgent and whats wrong with indulging the self anyway my point  and my problem  is that entry into this cult of wellness comes at a ridiculous cost in both the literal and metaphorical sense of the word forget for a moment the time commitment required society is being duped into believing you need a fitbit compression shorts and a 200 pair of lifting shoes to get in shape when a notebook sweatpants and chuck taylors will do just fine

of course theres always been a market that caters to the wellheeled peloton presents the most extreme example of this absurdity have you seen how much those bikes cost and then theres the monthly membership to boot you could fly firstclass to france and tour the countryside on your own damn bike for the same price the same goes for equinox  not a gym but a temple of wellbeing that charges its parishioners thousands of dollars for the privilege of spilling sweat inside its walls

pay attention to the way these products are being positioned peloton ads feature everyday average folks pedalling away on 3000 machines in their unspectacular homes lululemon ads feature everyday average folks running and bending and lifting in outfits that cost more than most people make in a day the message is clear yet entirely incongruent with reality at least equinox has the decency to showcase their upper crust offerings in the proper context in keeping with the tradition of aspirational luxury brands their ads make no sense at all

getting in shape doesnt require a payment plan or a line of credit ive spent time in posh gyms and ive spent time in musty warehouses and i can assure you there is next to no correlation between high fees and quality of service in toronto hone fitness offers memberships for as low as 30 a month and you can bring a friend whenever you want the ymca has 120 fitness centres across canada with fullyequipped weight rooms and loads of fitness classes their membership subsidy program ensures everyone regardless of income can cycle their stress away you may not be able to bathe yourself in eucalyptusinfused steam showers afterwards but really who needs that anyway

the video not only gives us a glimpse of products like the realme smartwatch and smart tv but it also shows that the company is ready to bring out a variety of iot products such as a realme weighing scale smart mirror and so on the company is aiming to expand its portfolio in the way xiaomi has been doing for the past several years

talking about the realme smartwatch we get to see a circular display and a possible amoled screen the company is trying to show off a seamless connectivity between its iot products like the smartwatch and realme buds air or between the smart speaker and smart tv

it is unclear when these products will launch but the teaser video suggests some of them may be ready for commercial launch we already know that the realme fitness band is set to launch this month the company will likely announce the product during the realme x50 pro launch event today ie february 24th at 230 pm ist

the realme smartwatch could be next in line and it could be an affordable product to take on the apple watch honor magic watch 2 and samsung galaxy watch active the realme smart speaker also suggests that the company will soon enter the smart speaker segment where players like amazon and google are dominating

we should know more about realmes plans for its tech lifestyle products during the realme x50 pro launch event later today for now it looks like the company has a busy 2020 ahead as it looks to go beyond smartphones ; west ham manager david moyes has been handed a boost this week as felipe anderson steps up his recovery from a back injury

the brazilian is working ahead of schedule having been ruled out for a month by moyes two weeks ago and has an outside chance of featuring against manchester city at the weekend

anderson shone in moyess first game back in charge scoring his first goal of the season in a 40 win over bournemouth his only premier league appearance since then  the 11 draw with sheffield united  saw him sustain the injury

speaking after anderson opened his account for the hammers this season moyes said i asked him if he was brazilian brazilians score goals brazilians make the difference they do something which makes us all excited

i said youre not doing that give me a brazilian goal and to be fair he did

moyes has been hit hard by injuries following his return to east london with michail antonio suffering hamstring problems and most notably goalkeeper lukasz fabianski having been in and out of the side

throughout moyes has been desperate to add some creative flair to his midfield with manuel lazinis form suffering and the hammers lacking pace going forward moyes brought in jarrod bowen from hull city on deadline day pipping crystal palace to a deal ; former watford coach quique sanchez flores has warned manchester united that odion ighalo will need one month to recover full rhythm

flores worked with the nigerian striker at vicarage road where he netted 39 goals across twoandahalf seasons with 16 of those coming in the premier league

ighalo has signed a sixmonth loan deal with united and arrived in the uk over the weekend from chinese side shanghai shenhua

mainly the problem is how they train in china it is not the same as in england

is he really ready for firstteam matches in the premier league because the physical difference is so big he probably needs one month to recover the full rhythm

the good thing is he knows his body well works hard on injury prevention and he is always working after training

i should say also that i felt in china he gave exactly the same effort and quality as he gave me four years ago we had the feeling in china that he could recover a high level with any team in europe flores told the athletic

flores however believes that ighalo will prove to be a good addition to ole gunnar solskjaers squad

i have an amazing impression of the player i fell in love with him as a guy hes professional hes a straight arrow as a person his life is private he has strong christian values and he is respectful

as a player it is difficult to explain ighalo his first quality is he can protect the ball and he gives time to the team to get up the field and win the second ball its so difficult to get the ball from him hes stronger than he looks

four years ago when we put ball in the space he was also super fast now with five years difference he is a bit different but he will always be fine in a physical battle

we played him up front in a two with troy deeney and they knew each other inside out but he is absolutely fine to play as a lone frontman too one of his most valuable qualities is that his teammates very quickly learn his strengths and he adapts very well he added

in a media release yesterday cwi said the pair did not attain the new minimum standard fitness requirements in recent fitness assessments and would not be part of the 15man squad led by allrounder kieron pollard

evin lewis and shimron hetmyer missed out due to the fact that they came up short in the fitness test chief selector roger harper explained

they will be missed lewis was the teams best batsman in the recent colonial medical insurance odi series against ireland where he batted with great composure and proved the bedrock for the teams series win

hetmyer appeared to be getting his act together and was an integral part of the teams batting group

the 28yearold lewis averages nearly 36 from 51 odis and has been one of the windies most dependable batsmen in recent times during the last eight months he has averaged nearly 43 from 16 matches

he smashed 208 runs at an average of 104 in three matches against ireland last month to earn man of the series honours

hetmyer meanwhile endured a poor series against ireland with scores of six and eight in the doubleheader in bridgetown before being axed for the final game ib3n grenada

allrounder rovman powell who averaged 58 with two exhilarating hundreds and fifties during the super50 has also earned a recall following 14 months on the sidelines while leftarm spinning allrounder fabian allen returns following injury

darren bravo and rovman powell owe their recall to their outstanding performance in the colonial medical super50 tournament harper said

bravo brings good form a renewed appetite for runs and lots of experience which will benefit the team tremendously powell who is back from injury will add batting firepower to the lineup increase the teams bowling options and strengthen the fielding unit

kayla was seen performing a lowintensity athome workout in the video and explained that it was not only great for expectant mothers but beginners as well she wore a pink sports bra black bike shorts and white sneakers to power through the exercises that required nothing more than a chair and a gym mat to complete

first up in kaylas workout routine was a set of modified burpees she placed her hands on the seat of the chair to step back into a modified plank position before stepping back toward the furniture and raising her arms high up in the air next up was a set of simple squats for this exercise the aussie workout queen simply stood with her feed shoulderlength apart and slowly squatted down to the seat of her chair

kayla followed this up with a set of tricep dips she gripped the edge of the chair while balancing on her heels which were stretched out in front of her slowly kayla was seen bending her elbows to a 90degree angle and then pushed back up to a full extension

the final part of the routine was a set of incline pushups kayla placed her knees on the ground and rested her hands on the seat of the chair before pushing her upper body up and down in a classic pushup movement

chelsea midfielder ruben loftuscheek has made a welcome return to action from a longterm heel injury after playing an hour of a behindcloseddoors friendly

the england international had not featured since suffering the achilles problem in a postseason friendly in boston last may

loftuscheek recently rejoined training with the firstteam and has now taken another step in his recovery when featuring in the 20 friendly defeat to brentford b on tuesday morning

chelsea said on the club website as part of his rehabilitation he played an hour at cobham for our development squad this morning he will continue to build up his fitness in the coming weeks

although the 24yearold is unlikely to be rushed back into club action should all go well in his recovery loftuscheek could play himself into contention for the england squad again when gareth southgates men prepare for euro 2020 this summer

blues manager frank lampard meanwhile will be hoping the winter break allows forward tammy abraham to fully recover from the ankle problem sustained against arsenal last month

antonio rudiger scored both goals as chelsea drew 22 against leicester which left them fourth in the premier league four points ahead of tottenham

chelsea are now not back in action again until they host manchester united on february 17  and also have both the resumption of their champions league campaign against bayern munich as well as an fa cup fifthround tie ahead ; whether youre counting steps or training for a triathlon technology can help heres what you need to amp up your fitness routine

21 billion thats how much google will pay for fitbit which has only been around since 2007 but is a star in the fitnesstech world and its hardly the only one garmin a company founded in 1989 and once known for gps devices saw 28 percent growth in its fitness division from the third quarter of 2018 to the same period in 2019 and just a few years ago in 2015 fitness clothing maker under armour bought myfitnesspal a free app that does little more than let users count calories the price 475 million theres big money behind fitness tech  and for good reason

the market for fitness technology is vast strong and growing it encompasses everything from weightloss apps to socks with builtin running sensors fitness tech has gone mainstream as wrist devices incorporate heart rate monitors step counters and sleepdetecting technology your bathroom scale can now check your heart health and your fulllength mirror can use augmented reality to become a virtual exercise class

ive reviewed lots of products in all these categories heres a comprehensive overview of what ive found to be the best assists for your health and fitness

fitness trackers are at the heart of the fitness technology movement they have broad appeal practically anybody can use them and you can extend a fitness trackers capabilities by connecting it to other devices and apps but their main appeal is that they can create a snapshot of your physical fitness at any given time  how active you are your weight fluctuation your resting heart rate how many calories you consume when you can see and understand your lifestyle youre better empowered to make healthy changes

at the most basic level fitness trackers count how many steps you take each day like an oldfashioned pedometer does theyre more accurate than pedometers however because they use accelerometers gyroscopes and sometimes gps to identify steps and motion so what does your step count tell you it shows how active or sedentary you are the number of steps you take in a day doesnt really matter but the average number of daily steps you take over the course of a year can indicate whether you need to be more active

most trackers also estimate how many calories you burn in a day based on your height weight gender and activity level most of them also double as sleep trackers some have heart rate monitors built into them too and fitness trackers can record exercise activities such as running and yoga to measure how long you did the activity how many extra calories you burned and sometimes your heart rate throughout the exercise

how do you view and make sense of all these numbers with a companion app of course there you can add more information such as what foods you eat and your weight blood pressure and in some trackers the phases of your menstrual cycle having all this information in one place helps you see what areas of your lifestyle you might want to improve do you get enough sleep do you move enough is your weight stable whats your average resting heart rate

a few examples of trackers that do a little bit of everything are the fitbit inspire hr and fitbit charge 3 these are both excellent options for anyone using a tracking for the first time theyre easy to use and its easy to read the data they collect

if youre more interested in having a fullfledged smartwatch that includes fitness tracking then the apple watch series 5 which does a bit of everything except measure sleep or samsung galaxy fit are the best options with a smartwatch you get apps and a lot more functionality such as the ability to send text messages from your watch but one major disadvantage is battery life the best fitness trackers can last a week or more but smartwatches usually need to be charged once a day

for runners cyclists and anyone else whos already invested in fitness the best option is a runners watch that doubles as an allday fitness tracker you can track your pace prs personal records and other advanced metrics for running or whatever your sport while counting steps and calorie burn throughout your day garmin makes some of the best watches in this category im especially fond of the forerunner series the 199 forerunner 45 tracks advanced running metrics and allday fitness the more expensive forerunner 945 59999 has storage for music so you can stream a playlist while on a run the 945 also tracks bicycling and openwater swims making it a great option for triathlons

looking at the number on the bathroom scale can change the tenor of your entire day weighing yourself and tracking your weight is as much a psychological game as a matter of health and fitness with a smart bathroom scale you can weigh in without having to look at your numbers or at least delay it until the time is right the best scales sync your weight body fat and other metrics wirelessly to an app or web account where you or your health care professionals can look at them later

a really good bathroom scale measures more than just weight it also captures body fat bone density water percentage bone mass and sometimes even heart rate the withings body cardio does all that and it can report the days weather forecast too

many of the big names in fitness tracking offer scales that sync your weighins to the same app you use to track your steps and activities for example fitbit makes the fitbit aria 2 smart scale garmin and polar make bathroom scales for their apps as well

but you dont necessarily need a scale made by the same company for it to work with your other health and fitness devices for apple watch users any scale that works with apple health will do the qardiobase 2 is one example its a fantastic scale with a beautiful design and it has a switch that lets you turn off impedance measurements making it safe for people who are pregnant or have implanted electrical devices such as pacemakers

if youre serious about fitness you need a heart rate monitor hrm theyre usually either chest straps or watchstyle devices and they read your pulse while you work out theyre not meant for monitoring your heart rate 247 for medical purposes while youre inactive for that you should look for a heart rate monitor thats fdaapproved or the equivalent in your country

a fitness hrm reads your pulse while youre running lifting weights interval training bicycling or doing any other kind of activity how high you push your heart rate during a workout and how long you keep it there affects the benefits of that workout for fitness purposes there are five heart rate zones theyre based on your minimum and maximum heart rate sometimes called hrmax zone 1 is around 50 to 60 percent of your hrmax and thats what youd see during very light activity the scale goes up in increments of 10 until youre at maximum effort which is 90 to 100 percent of your hrmax

the exact numbers for heart rate zones are based on a persons health weight age and other factors a doctor can help you figure out these numbers some hrms and their companion apps have a test that helps you estimate your hrmax and calculate heart rate zones or even determine your v02max another number that athletes use to help them train

generally speaking exercise in zones 2 and 3 is considered fatburning working out in zones 4 and 5 is meant to benefit cardio health and endurance training polars heart rate monitors including the polar oh1 have excellent tools for finding your heart rate zones as well as feedback screens youll see after a workout that explain the benefits of that particular activity for your heart and body

as for wristbased hrms some are fitness trackers or running watches with a heart rate sensor built in some are standalone hrms that look like armbands fitness trackers and running watches often let you see your heart rate in real time  so while youre running you can glance down and see your pulse cheststrap hrms and standalone hrm armbands dont have screens so to see your heart rate while working out you need to pair them with a compatible app that can show it otherwise youll see the heart rate data at the end of the workout after you sync the device with an app

some fitness apps have special features for hrms such as announcing your pulse via audio imagine you have headphones on while running and are listening to workout music every so often a voice chimes in to say heart rate 155 beats per minute distance one mile

while the majority of hrms are chest straps and watches some are headphones that take your pulse from your ear one example is jbls reflect fit earbased devices arent nearly as mainstream as chest straps and wristwatches but they are available the reason for putting an hrm on the ear is because the skin there is quite thin making it easy to take an accurate reading theres also been some experimentation with building hrms into the straps of sports bras by makers such as sensoria and mi pulse

nearly all hrms are waterresistant enough to handle sweat and rain but only a few can read heart rate accurately during a swim the garmin hrmswim and the polar oh1 can

the price for a good hrm varies based on whether its used strictly for measuring heart rate 60 to 100 or has additional features the wahoo tickr x 99 for instance doubles as a runtracker and can count reps when you lift weights and as mentioned plenty of running watches and fitness trackers include a hrm that usually pushes the price above 199

perhaps youre lucky enough to have seen the old tv commercials for total gym that starred actionmovie hero and blackbelt master chuck norris the ads are legendary but the home gym equipment was a clunker compared to what you can get today now the best home gym technology not only is beautifully designed but also brings interactive classes right into your living room

among the most wellknown of these products is the superhighend peloton bike maybe youve seen the peloton memes showing the smart stationary bike in unrealistic locations for all but the onepercenters of the world if you can afford one of these 2245 bikes you ride it while following along with a class on a display set in front of the handlebars you can join a spin class virtually and compete with others around the world who have joined the same class you must also pay a monthly subscription fee for the classes on top of buying the bike but it could be a worthwhile investment if you spend that much per year on studio classes peloton also has a treadmill called peloton tread with a hefty starting price of 4295

athome gym systems have evolved not only by incorporating classes but also in their design some are so handsome and discreet that they blend in with your livingroom furniture the sleekest of all the homegym tech options are smart fitness mirrors when not in use they hang on your wall or lean against it like normal fulllength mirrors turn one on and you get an augmented reality experience an overlay of information appears such as fitness classes you can join from home as you participate in the class you use the mirror to check your form as well as to see whats happening in the class

fitness mirrors are especially good for yoga floor pilates bodyweight calisthenics and other exercises that require little more than a few square feet and a mat two smart mirrors on the market now are echelon reflect 163998 for the 50inch version and one simply called mirror 1495 both can connect to a hrm chest strap so you can track your pulse as you complete the class or compare your heart rate from previous classes mirror also recently started offering oneonone training sessions 40 per session via a video call with a trainer

if you want something in between a smart mirror and the chuck norris workout of yore tonal 2995 plus tax delivery and 49 per month fits the bill its a wallmounted display with bars and pulleys attached that you use for strength training

when all else fails fitness apps can save the day i cant think of a single fitnessrelated goal or activity that doesnt have an app for it if you dont want to buy a fitness tracker or cant afford one you can use an app and your phone if homegym equipment doesnt make sense for you apps can coach you through workouts you can even read your heart rate with some mobile phones with an app that uses the camera and flash to take your pulse through your fingertip some apps are free some require a onetime purchase or subscription lets look at some examples

for free workouts i like the johnson  johnson official 7minute workout this app has a variety of workouts for people of all fitness levels some are only seven minutes long but you can find others that go longer most workouts need nothing more than a little bit of space and maybe a chair or a mat theyre great for people who are just getting started with exercise and for frequent travelers as you can do the workouts in a hotel room quickly and easily

runners likely already know there are plenty of runtracking apps such as runkeeper and strava these apps use your phone or a compatible watch or fitness tracker to record your pace distance mileage and more

on ios devices you can turn on a setting in the apple health app to turn your phone into a pedometer no fitness tracker required apps such as mapmyfitness can do the same thing mapmyfitness can also track nonsport activities as part of your fitness plan  for instance shoveling snow raking leaves or walking briskly

counting calories looking to manage your weight myfitnesspal is one of the best apps for logging the foods you eat to count calories and get a nutritional breakdown of your meals most apps in this category come with a barcode scanner so you can easily get nutritional information from packaged foods weight watchers has an app that goes with its online subscriptionbased program for losing weight as do a few newcomers to the space including noom and lifesum weight watchers and noom include access to coaches through the app as well as community aspects so you wont be alone on your fitness journey

what about apps that offer challenging workouts and exercise classes if you want hardcore training by an mma champion touchfit gsp gives you a series of videos by fighter george stpierre hence the gsp in the name that get harder or easier depending on how difficult you rate each exercise jillian michaels has a similar app with videobased workouts and her app comes with a diet plan im a fan of the bubbly and perky cassey ho whose blogilates workouts are always so much harder than they seem like theyll be

you can livestream classes and join them virtually with apps and sites such as fortefit and openfit which recently acquired gixo another live and ondemand exercise class app both forte and openfit offer a range of classes everything from core and ab workouts to cardiointensive classes with options for ondemand and live then there are apps and sites that specialize in one type of class such as ballet barre and yoga and through apps such as trainiac you can even get a personal trainer to work with you on a personal fitness plan

you may have heard for example that the blue light from screens  mobile phones tablets and computers that we put just a foot or two from our eyes  can disrupt our sleep ill admit i used to be skeptical of this claim until one of the worlds leading chronobiologists told me it was true this blue light is similar to the light from the sun when we view it our bodies believe its daytime and dont produce melatonin a chemical that helps it fall asleep some people have a stronger response to blue light than others

what do we do about blue light theres a setting on most computers and mobile devices that reduces or eliminates blue light between hours that you set you can set your computer to emit a more reddish hue between the hours of say 630 pm and 700 am if your device doesnt have a blue light or night shift setting you can install an app to do the job flux and iris are two good options

in addition to minimizing exposure to blue light at night sleep experts say its important to get adequate exposure to natural light during the day too often people blame their computers for poor sleep but dont realize that exposure to sunlight helps keep the body on an appropriate sleep schedule

how else can technology help us sleep better you can track your sleep to learn more about your sleep patterns what time do you get into bed what time do you fall asleep how often do you wake up during the night when do you get out of bed for good you cant change a behavior if you dont know what it is sleep trackers can help you collect the data you need most fitness trackers now include sleep tracking the apple watch being an exception

if you dont like wearing a wristband while you sleep other sleep trackers go on your bed instead including smart mattresses with tracking technology built in these devices are often more accurate than wristbands because they include sensors for respiration and they can more accurately sense how you shift while you sleep the most advanced such as the sleep number 360 make adjustments during the night that are tailored to you  say warming your feet you can spend from about 900 to 4299 for one of these beds at the top end is the california king sleep number m7 smart bed with temperaturebalancing and pressurerelieving features

a company called eight sleep also sells smart mattresses with thermoregulating features for a slightly lower price its newest product the pod costs 2495 for a queensize mattress

there are simpler solutions than buying a new mattress of course the nokia sleep is a sleepsensing pad that you slip under your mattress and at 99 its a comparative bargain or you could consider a smart pillow that plays white noise and detects snoring such as the remfit zeeq smart pillow although a pcmag analyst found it rather disappointing when she tested it

once you have data you can look for reasons you wake up in the night or ways to get more sleep i recently looked over sleep data from my fitbit charge 3 and noticed that when i get into bed before 10 pm i sleep at least 20 minutes more per night than when i stay up later its a small change but cumulatively i can get up to two more hours of sleep per week and a colleague once kept waking up in the middle of the night he tracked his sleep and noticed it always happened at the same time he eventually discovered that a certain noise occurred every night at the same time for him ear plugs did the trick

within the fitness tech market there are plenty of darlings but just as many duds its tough to predict whats going to take off and whats going to flop

smart waterbottles that track your water consumption and remind you to drink always seemed like a cashgrab gimmick just because you can put a sensor on something and hook it up to your mobile phone doesnt mean you should companies such as thermos and hidrate decided to try anyway the results are about as lacking in innovation and utility as you would imagine

when smart clothing came along i approached those products  bras capris tops  with an optimistic but skeptical eye a pair of bluetoothconnected running socks by sensoria now in version 20 showed a lot of early promise they give feedback to runners about their form in real time commenting on heel strikes cadence and the like promising as they may be theyre still very much under the radar of most runners and tech enthusiasts keep an eye on smart clothing as a category and youll see a lot of products coming soon witness the smart yoga outfit from pivot which claims it will give you feedback about your alignment as you go through postures using the companys app for yoga classes but isnt yet available

under armour has been pushing a whole line of smart sneakers for nearly two years these shoes have a sensor that collects data about runs it sends the data to the mapmyrun app which under armour owns for analysis and review the shoes last about a year and dont cost much more than a typical pair of running sneakers between 100 and 140

some fitness enthusiasts have been sold on the idea that the secret to maximizing their fitness potential is in their blood a service called insidetracker will send a phlebotomist to your home or office to collect a blood sample and send it to a lab costing you anywhere from 299 to 589 depending on the service you choose when the results are in you get a detailed reading of biomarkers in your blood iron glucose calcium sodium etc plus recommendations for changes mostly dietary that might adjust them into an optimal range to reduce your zinc eat fewer bagels and more zucchini for 49 you can upload your blood data from a screening youve done elsewhere and get a similar report

bear in mind that insidetracker isnt fdaapproved and therefore does not give medical diagnoses something a nutritionistregistered dietitian flagged as a potential problem when i asked for her insight about it she said if certain biomarkers are outside the ideal range the reason might be something unrelated to food and general lifestyle if you have hepatitis we need to know that you have hepatitis she said

your blood may or may not give you pointers for improving your health but what about your poop human biome analysis kit ubiome creates a picture of your gut health from a tiny swab of fecal matter you send to a lab right now the service seems to be more in the business of collecting data than providing actionable information it told me my gut had a high level of artificial sweetener which i dont eat at all and that i have a possible intolerance to gluten not even a chance

there is no stone or muscle left untouched when it comes to fitness tech and should your muscles get sore from all the activity you could always try zapping the pain away using a tens transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation unit such as the power dot 20 and its companion app ; midfielder ruben loftuscheek has yet to feature for chelsea this season mike egertonpa

indias only olympic medal hopeful weightlifter mirabai chanus main aim is to stay injuryfree in the buildup to the final round of the qualifications in april where she targets to lift a personal best of 210 kilograms

having recovered fully from a back injury that forced her out of the 2018 asian games the 2017 world champion has progressed gradually from a total of 199kg to 201kg and in the senior nationals here on tuesday she improved it to 203kg thereby bettering her own national record

i tried 207kg today but lost balance but im confident that i will be able to lift 210kg at the asian championships mirabai said after winning the womens 49kg category gold

but the most important thing is to stay free from injury which is very common in our sport so i got to be watchful its also about staying relaxed when theres no training i love to listen to music to relax i also take sauna and steam bath three times a week for better performance she said

mirabai is also keeping a close watch on her diet so that she keeps her weight in check ahead of the asian championships in nursultan from april 16 to 25 the final olympic qualification

i eat boiled food and more of red meat i stay away from oil and spicy food pressure is always there when whole of india is expecting a medal but i am happy that i have the chance to do something for india so i will put my best foot forward mirabai who had a disappointing campaign at the 2016 rio olympics said

she is currently ranked fourth in the world behind the chinese duo of huihua jiang 212kg and zhihui hou 211kg and korean ri song gum 209kg a total of 13 lifters will make the cut for tokyo olympics in every category after the the kazakhstan event

training at nis patiala national camp meant that mirabai has not gone home to manipur for long and she misses her favourite dish iromba a curry made with fermented fish as an ingredient

i miss it but at the end of the day we are here to achieve something for our country and thats the priority i will visit my home once i achieve something big mirabai signed off

national coach vijay sharma said his ward is on the right track for tokyo olympics

we missed two lifts if she had cleared one either in snatch or clean and jerk we could have achieved the target here our target here was between 203205kg sharma said

she was not at her peak from its the precompetition period our target was this only we wanted to give a check and i think she is on right track

mirabais next target is to achieve 210kg in the asian championships

we have planned our journey as per our limits we dont want to rush things keeping injuries in mind but im strongly hopeful we can make it sharma said

on the chinese challenge he said they have been doing 210kgplus for last four years but we have gradually improved from 194kg and reached 203kg today

its about making some minor adjustments and focus strongly on the fitness and powerstrengthening ahead of the qualifying meet sharma said

the national coach also spoke highly of the youth olympic champion jeremy lalrinnunga and said the target for the mizo teenager is to qualify for the olympics before targeting a medal in 2024 paris olympics

the new jerseyborn rossi came up through manchester uniteds youth academy and went on to post four consecutive doubledigit goals seasons for villarreal in la liga before injuries became an increasing factor in his career

hes here and were taking a look at him like anyone else and seeing what he can offer to the team juarez told the tribunes alex vejar if that presents itself then we have to take it a day at a time because hes been out of soccer for a while

now age 33 rossi scored 16 times for fiorentina as recently as the 201314 season but hasnt played since 2018 after testing positive for a banned substance he avoided a longterm doping ban however

according to vejar juarez may be willing to give rossi some time to get back closer to full fitness before deciding whether to offer him a spot on the roster

emily a vogels for pew research center

around threeinten americans living in households earning 75000 or more a year 31 say they wear a smart watch or fitness tracker on a regular basis compared with 12 of those whose annual household income falls below 30000 differences by education follow a similar pattern with college graduates adopting these devices at higher rates than those who have a high school education or less according to the survey of 4272 us adults

women are more likely than men to say they regularly use these devices 25 vs 18 hispanic adults are more likely than whites to report regularly wearing a fitness tracker 26 vs 20 while black adults fall in between at 23

recently some concerns have been raised over who can and should have access to this health data military analysts have also expressed concern about how third parties can use the data to find out where there is an american military presence about fourinten americans 41 say it is acceptable for makers of fitness trackers to share users data with medical researchers seeking to better understand the link between exercise and heart disease while a somewhat smaller share 35 believes this is an unacceptable practice another 22 are unsure if this is an acceptable practice or not

along with apple watches on our left wrists we wear simple fitbit trackers fitbit flex 2 bands on our right wrists because we like to compete with our friends who wear fitbits

if an apple watch app existed that displayed our fitbit steps wed be all set with flex 2 units in our apple watch bands and the data displayed on apple watchs display fitbits app unsurprisingly does not offer an apple watch component of course even better would be for fitbit to recognize apple watch steps and allow users to incorporate them into the fitbit data including allowing that step data to count in challenges even though our fitbit steps never match our apple watch steps  macdailynews july 1 2017 ; need a boost that will help you get on top of your health and fitness goals well youre in luck  one of the best fitness trackers you can buy has now been discounted by over 50

darren bravo the experienced toporder batsman has won a recall following an impressive domestic season in which he made 481 runs at an average of 9620 in the super50 cup while allrounder rovman powell also makes the cut following an impressive run of his own in the same competition he scored 412 runs at an imperious strike rate of 16093 for jamaica

iwobi injured his hamstring playing against former club arsenal on the december day carlo ancelotti was officially appointed everton manager

the 23yearold confessed he was itching to show what i could do during six weeks on the sidelines when italian ancelotti launched his reign on a positive note

iwobi showed enough on the training pitch following his recovery to be selected for saturdays encounter

he was on the field for 65 minutes as everton recovered from 20 down to draw level  and hared up the touchline to join the wild celebrations which followed theo walcotts 90thminute winning strike

there is no better feeling than coming back and winning and it was the perfect day for me iwobi told evertontv i did not expect to come straight back in the manager had us guessing with the set pieces we did on friday so we did not know who was playing

but we were all ready to start whenever it was my time i knew i would be ready

at times my reactions were a bit slow but that will come the more i am playing i felt okay not leggy at all

i always pushed on during his recovery even when i was told to relax  i tried to show i was able to get back fit

i was eager to be back especially with a new manager i was itching to show him what i could do ; gordon elliott has urged caution ahead of tiger rolls return in the boyne hurdle at navan on sunday week but he expects the peoples horse to be fighting for the cheltenham festival

the backtoback aintree grand national winner was sidelined for a month with a minor setback and elliott expects the 10yearold to come on for his reappearance before bidding for a cross country chase hattrick at the cotswolds next month

tiger roll is in great form and did his first bit of work on saturday morning hes one hundred per cent the plan is to go for the boyne hurdle in navan on sunday february 16 elliott said

hes not going to be as fit as he was last year there will be a lot of improvement in him and it will be a stepping stone to the cross country at cheltenham

meanwhile owner rich ricci has mooted the possibility of supplementing willie mullins star mare benie des dieux for the champion hurdle at cheltenham and swerving entries in the mares hurdle and the stayers hurdle

i havent spoken to willie yet we havent had a discussion about it would we supplement her for the champion hurdle i dont know i dont know if shell be fast enough but its something youll have to consider ricci said ; the point has often been raised that rangers have made the same mistakes this term as they did last following their return to action after the premiership break

the defeat to kilmarnock 12 months ago sticks in the memory but rangers didnt struggle in the premiership after that as many believe they did in fact the draw with st johnstone was the only league game in the next half a dozen where they dropped points

it wasnt until march where four points were lost before the old firm defeat at parkhead where the wheels really came off the title challenge in the same month aberdeen ended rangers scottish cup hopes as the campaign allbut ended and gerrard cannot afford for hamilton to do likewise on saturday

many fans have blamed the time that rangers spent in dubai as the reason for their sluggish performances this time around some claim it was a holiday while others say gerrard overworked his players

given the expertise of his staff the amount of data available and the hours of analysis work that is put in it is hard to believe that rangers returned to glasgow not in fine physical shape and gerrard insisted it was not fitness related on saturday the break was needed after a hectic first half of the campaign but it certainly interrupted rangers momentum once again and players have found it difficult to pick up where they left off

gerrard accepted that questions would be asked over his players mentality in the aftermath of the defeat at tynecastle and the draw with the dons will have done little to answer them

the likes of allan mcgregor and steven davis know what it takes to lift trophies at ibrox but rangers are clearly at a disadvantage compared to celtic when it comes to getting over the line and winning medals

that is not to say that the gers dont have the bottle for the title battle or that they are not desperate to deliver success this term but it would be no surprise if the huge pressure on their shoulders is weighing heavily at present

the demand from the stands is as great as it has been for many many years right now and that clamour and desire for the title creates a difficult environment in which to perform

gerrard has often said that he needs the support to stick with his side and that is as important now as ever as rangers look to hang on to celtics coattails at the top of the table

gerrard spoke about spark on saturday and there is no doubt that rangers have lost their edge and are not as freeflowing in the final third the addition of ianis hagi and florian kamberi should give the side more creativity and there needs to be a greater urgency about the way rangers play

the hightempo high press approach has drifted in recent weeks and rangers are not sharp enough in the final third right now as they find it difficult to break down compact defences

gerrard has stuck to the 4321 formation for most of the campaign but rangers are perhaps now too predictable at times it wont be overhauled but a tweak could help rangers unlock their attacking prowess again

this is perhaps the most important point at present and the reason why rangers have been so unimpressive in their recent outings put simply too many players havent operated to their full potential and are out of form

add that to the loss of james tavernier and alfredo morelos and it becomes clearer why rangers havent looked the same side in recent weeks

tavernier has been a huge miss in an attacking sense and it is only now when he has not been in the side that his critics will perhaps see how important he is to it

rangers could get by without morelos against stranraer and st mirren but his style was far better suited to hearts away than jermain defoe on saturday his lack of sharpness told as he squandered a giltedged chance when through oneonone

having both tavernier and morelos back will undoubtedly make a real difference and should raise levels across the park

every player and every side will go through lean periods over a campaign and the timing couldnt have been worse for the likes of steven davis and glen kamara to drop their levels more should be expected from ryan kent and joe aribo as well and the backup isnt quite there for rangers with the likes of jordan jones and brandon barker unable to capitalise on the opportunity that has presented itself

individually and collectively rangers are capable of far better and they have shown that already this term they havent become a bad side over a winter break but they must become a better one almost overnight if they are to get their campaign back on track ; since the super bowl was yesterday football is a topic of conversation football has also been in the news for another more serious reason  the association with traumatic brain injury over the years it has been reported that several former nfl players suffered from brain injury as a result of concussions sustained over years of playing some players have even retired early in their careers in an attempt to avoid such injury far from being an nfl problem the issue of sportsrelated concussion is something that should concern young athletes who play football and other sports as well as coaches and parents

football especially at the professional and college level has long been known for violent collisions an obvious concern is that players could sustain a careerending injury and head injuries including concussions are particularly worrisome in particular repeated concussions can cause a degenerative brain disease called chronic traumatic encephalopathy or cte the 2015 motion picture concussion brought this issue to the attention of a wider audience but many sports medicine professionals have been aware of this problem for years a recent report suggests that cte may be far more common than previously thought

a concussion is caused by the brain moving forcibly inside the skull as the result of the head striking an object another player or the ground or simply the head moving violently without hitting anything because of this concussions and subconcussive injuries can occur even when an athlete doesnt lose consciousness or appear to be injured this can put athletes at increased risk for multiple injuries in a season  or even in a single game this last part is critical because much of the permanent damage comes from a second concussion sustained before the first has healed completely

new rules banning helmettohelmet contact are part of an effort to reduce the risk of concussions off the field players are subjected to special screening to detect concussions assess recovery and determine if it is safe to return to play improvements in equipment including helmet technology that can monitor potentially concussive hits may also help reduce the risks of serious injury

despite these efforts some experts believe that football is simply too dangerous and have called for tackling to be banned these concerns are more frequently expressed when it comes to youth football the evidence that accumulated brain trauma sustained by young athletes can have immediate and lasting effects has led some communities schools and even whole states to consider banning tackling in youth football

this is complicated by the fact that other sports also have a high risk of concussion including hockey and soccer in fact heading has been banned in some competitive youth soccer leagues and there is the fact that all sports have some risk of injury including concussions furthermore youth sports including football provide a great many young people with opportunities to be active promote growth and development enhance academic achievement and have fun the effect of banning tackling in football or heading in soccer on the health social and educational opportunities for young athletes is unknown and should be considered

whether policies like these are practical or not remains to be seen in the meantime there are steps we can take to make all sports safer for young athletes we should make sure that coaches are educating players how to compete as safely as possible instead of emphasizing winning at all costs we should also advocate for having certified athletic trainers at all games and practices to teach players safe techniques assess and treat injuries and ensure appropriate return to play most of all we should be mindful of the risks of playing sports while encouraging kids of all ages to be active play and have fun ; cricket west indies cwi ceo johnny grave has pointed out that fitness standards will be crucial when it comes to selection of players for the west indies test one day international and t20 international teams

on monday cwi announced that lefthanded batsmen evin lewis and shimron hetmyer will miss the tour of sri lanka after failing to reach the new minimum standard fitness requirements in recent fitness assessments

during a telephone interview on monday grave mentioned in our strength and conditioning policy theyre tested twice every year obviously players will be retested if they fail

the next testing is due in june he added players have to be at a minimum standard in order to be considered for selection

according to the cwi ceo the fitness tests do two things one it makes sure that you fit the minimum standards required for selection the other one is that every player has a personal target to hit

if you miss your personal target you can be fined two weeks wages so there are two elements to the fitness tests in terms of injuries players will conduct what is called a returntoplay policy so the medical screenings are for players who are carrying injuries separately

allrounder fabian allen and wicketkeeperbatsman nicholas pooran were selected for the odi team for sri lanka after overcoming recent leg injuries

grave mentioned there were some players who didnt take part in the fitness testing fabian allen for example got a knee injury during the india tour he would do a fitness test nicholas pooran had a minor surgery after the ireland series on his foot

he added shannon gabriel and rakheem cornwall didnt do any tests because theyre recovering from their injuries

grave noted the remaining cwi contracted players took part in their stipulated fitness tests between january 2831 in four locations  trinidad including players from the leeward islands and windward islands guyana jamaica and barbados

the tests were conducted by the mens team strength and conditioning coach ronald rogers and fellow trinidadian dr oba gulston who serves as the cwi sports science and medicine manager ; petaling jaya feb 4  it was an unforgettable moment when siti aminah borhan got to look out over the clouds at the top of mount kinabalu with her threeyearold daughter sofia

the fitness coach and her daughter began the gruelling hike on january 28 and successfully reached the 4095metre high peak after 19 hours

siti aminah is now hoping that sofia can potentially earn a spot in the malaysian book of records as the youngest person to reach mount kinabalus summit

in a series of facebook posts she shared her experience of conquering the tallest mountain in the malay archipelago with a young child in tow and the challenges they faced including unpredictable weather with temperatures dipping as low as two degrees celsius

the journey wasnt easy but this is a memory that will last a lifetime

thankfully everything went smoothly and throughout the journey sofia didnt make a fuss and she occasionally walked on her own without needing to be carried the whole time wrote siti aminah

to combat the cold siti aminah made sure to wrap her daughter up in four layers of sweaters and trousers that kept her warm and snug

after receiving backlash from some social media users who thought the climb was too risky for a child of sofias age siti aminah clarified that they were accompanied by a guide and a doctor all the way

for those asking about sofias safety we did not go alone

i was with a doctor who made sure sofia was okay and he helped us along the journey

before embarking on the mission siti aminah said she put herself through a twoday training course at bukit maragang in kundasang sabah to prepare herself for the challenge

she described the path to mount kinabalus peak as a neverending flight of stairs that almost made her want to give up

when i looked up at those stairs i almost wanted to cry

i asked god what am i doing here i should just be staying at home and relaxing

but sofia she made everything easier she didnt say she wanted to go back once nor did she throw a tantrum

sofias patience and endurance of the steep ascent gave siti aminah the strength to power on and they were rewarded with stunning views at the mountaintop ; lyle taylor piled praise on andre green for his display in charltons 21 win over barnsley  starring despite the loss of his grandad earlier in the week

the aston villa loanee scored the second goal for the addicks in se7

taylor had put charlton 10 ahead with his eighth strike of the campaign but revealed afterwards that he was physically struggling

for 45 minutes or as long as my legs were holding out me and dre were a real handful said taylor

i have to heap praise on him hes had a tough week with family stuff

for him to turn up and do what he did today  you could see what that goal meant to him

taylor has only just returned from a thigh problem and also missed a sigificant chunk of the campaign with knee ligament damage

i just need to get fitter he said i started cramping just before halftime minor little cramps but after halftime my legs were going  i couldnt sustain that level of effort

dre did a lot of my running he deserved to get the three points and definitely deserved the goal

taylor finished from close range after jason pearce headed down josh cullens freekick

its a poachers goal said the former afc wimbledon and millwall forward its a strikers goal its always nice striking the ball in the top corner from 25 yards but the ones from five six seven or eight yards they are the nice ones

you have to be in the right place at the right time its a ball in the box you hope someone gets up and wins the first one and then i stuck it beyond the keeper you ask questions if youre onside or offside later

taylor gave the barnsley fans a wave when he came off in the second half

he also cupped his ears towards them in the first period while waiting for a charlton corner to come in

i thought they loved me by the end of the game said taylor the more they scream shout and boo the harder im going to go

how they didnt get one of their players sent off i really dont know the referee was a little bit reticent to send him off after already issuing a booking and then two minutes later he books the other one

but thats one win ticked off and we now prepare for next weekend i dont look at the table or who were playing next  its just the next game the next game thats no disrespect to anyone in this league its just how i go into it

taylor was quick to praise the home support with an attendance of more than 19000 at the valley

they help us in our lulls in performances during the 90 minutes knowing that wall behind the goal are screaming shouting and urging us on ; shubman gill will be replacing rohit sharma for the test series against new zealand which will commence from february 21 the second test is scheduled to begin on february 29

evin lewis and shimron hetmyer missed out due to the fact that they came up short in the fitness test chief selector roger harper explained

they will be missed lewis was the teams best batsman in the recent colonial medical insurance odi series against ireland where he batted with great composure and proved the bedrock for the teams series win

hetmyer appeared to be getting his act together and was an integral part of the teams batting group

the 28yearold lewis averages nearly 36 from 51 odis and has been one of the windies most dependable batsmen in recent time during the last eight months he has averaged nearly 43 from 16 matches

he plundered 208 runs at an average of 104 in three matches against ireland last month to earn manoftheseries honours

hetmyer meanwhile endured a poor series against ireland with scores of six and eight in the doubleheader in bridgetown before being axed for the final game in grenada

only last december his magnificent 139 against india in chennai earned west indies a comprehensive eightwicket win in the opener of the threematch series

overall he averages nearly 37 from 45 odis with five hundreds

meanwhile experienced lefthander darren bravo has been recalled to the side four months after being dropped for the tour of afghanistan over his poor form

since then the 30yearold has rediscovered his touch with nearly 500 runs at an average of 96 during last novembers super50 cup and has averaged 50 from four innings in the first class championship so far this year

allrounder rovman powell who averaged 58 with two exhilarating hundreds and fifties during the super50 has also earned a recall following 14 months on the sidelines while leftarm spinning allrounder fabian allen returns following injury

darren bravo and rovman powell owe their recall to their outstanding performance in the colonial medical super50 tournament said harper

bravo brings good form a renewed appetite for runs and lots of experience which will benefit the team tremendously powell who is back from injury will add batting firepower to the lineup increase the teams bowling options and strengthen the fielding unit

west indies leave this week for the series which opens in colombo on february 22 and continues with matches in hambantota four days later with the final match set for kandy on march 1

her promising rookie season was cut short however by an injury that even ebon could not shrug off after establishing herself as the lady tamaraws top scoring option as a freshman disaster struck for ebon when she injured her knee against the adamson university lady falcons on march 24

she had to be stretchered off the court and missed the rest of the season  including feus run to the final 4 as the no 4 seed

ganoon pa din yung mindset ko pero noong nagpacheck up yun acl pala talaga she said in obvious disappointment

pakistans wicketkeeperbatsman kamran akmal in an interview with gtv network defended batsman umar akmal after the latter was alleged to have exposed himself in front of his trainer during a recent fitness test

the wicketkeeperbatsman claimed that the incident did not happen as reported and asked the pakistan cricket board pcb to bring all parties together in an effort to sort out the problem

i dont think anything like that happened if something like this happened then they should call the parties involved as i said i believe no arguments occurred this was a total misunderstanding the trainer and umar are good friends they have studied in the same school if the person involved found something wrong then i think umar can apologize but i dont think he did anything intentionally akmal said

the 38yearold claimed that if a player was not living up to the required fitness standards than it was the job of the fitness trainer to help the players

if the players are not living up to the requirements then i think it is the job of the trainer to work things out in that case all players have to work out extra hard they are doing that we are preparing for the psl without preparations you cant play an entire tournament if they are not fit he said

akmal claimed that umar had worked very hard to enhance his performances in order to be considered for the national side

honestly i can say that he has worked really hard we are all sad about his exclusion from the national side he is a player that the team needs but still isnt in the team he has been working very hard he is very passionate about a comeback this is a total misunderstanding i hope the pcb calls all the parties involved and clears out whatever it is this was nothing big if anything he should be given a warning and asked to move on he said

the wicketkeeperbatsman believed that the current fitness tests were harder than ever before and stressed the need to prioritise skills over fitness

they are treating everyone the same as far as fitness is concerned we are all working hard if you work on skills it automatically enhances your fitness the new test is not that easy it has become increasingly hard now they should check for performances more from the coaches to get an idea he concluded

earlier pakistan middleorder batsman umar akmal landed in hot water once again after he was allegedly accused of misbehaving in the presence of a foreign fitness trainer at the national cricket academy in lahore

according to sources when the foreign trainer wanted to measure umar akmals body fat the 29yearold took off all his clothes angrily and questioned the trainer do you see any fat in my body ; though the indian cricket establishment is basking in the glory of clinching a 50 win in the t20i series in new zealand it has headaches to address

though the indian cricket establishment is basking in the glory of clinching a 50 win in the t20i series in new zealand it has headaches to address there are snags in its injury management system either in detection or in the course of rehabilitation problems are occurring at an alarming rate wriddhiman saha had to undergo surgery after his shoulder injury went unnoticed for a while it was also not diagnosed on time that bhuvneshwar kumar had sports hernia which needed operation

there were conflicting reports on the recovery status of jasprit bumrah and hardik pandya although the former is back nobody knows when pandya will be with the t20 world cup coming up in october these are worrying signsever since injuries became part of a sportsmans career methods have been developed to prevent and minimise the damage remember david beckham spending time in a lowoxygen tent to recover from a broken leg before the 2002 world cup the bcci has the national cricket academy nca in bengaluru to address these things

going by examples it cant be called very efficient in monitoring or speeding up the recovery process pandya for example was declared fit only to be deemed otherwise a few days later of late the increasing involvement of ipl teams and their professionals in the rehabilitation programme has complicated matters since the priorities of these franchises and the national team are different

busy plotting changes in the new constitution the bcci bosses will do well to start thinking of a revamp of its injury management system given the cricket calendar there are bound to be muscle pulls stress fractures and other niggles since the bcci is subjecting its players to this gruelling schedule it becomes its responsibility to make sure that they last long enough

over the years the fitness assessment mechanism has gone neglected and little attention has been paid to improving what was in place with a former national captain heading it this bcci regime is expected to handle this aspect better than predecessors however other than routine announcements sourav ganguly is still to do anything in this regard ; pakistans outoffavor wicketkeeper umar akmal could face disciplinary actions due to misconduct during the fitness test

pakistans outoffavor wicketkeeper umar akmal could face disciplinary action after he reportedly asked a trainer where is the fat while exposing himself completely during a fitness test

the matter has been reported to the pakistan cricket board pcb and according to an espncricinfo report they are fully aware of the incident that took place at the national cricket academy and is looking at potential punishments for bringing the game into disrepute

the junior akmal who is reported to have exposed himself in frustration after failing to pass one of the fitness tests is now faced with the prospect of being banned from the countrys next domestic tournament

he is said to have asked a staff bataye charbee kaha hain tell me where is the fat

fitness has been an issue with the akmal brothers for several years now with umar falling out with the pcb on the same grounds during mickey arthurs time as head coach

this comes at a time when the pcb under the stewardship of former captain misbahulhaq has pledged its commitment to maintaining high fitness standards not just in international but also in domestic cricket

as per misbahs instructions each provincial side is required to regulate fitness tests on a quarterly basis

umars elder brother kamran who himself skipped two fitness tests before failing in nearly all departments when he finally did take one said the incident at the nca was simply a misunderstanding

once seen as a bright prospect umar scored a century on test debut against new zealand in 2009 and remained a regular feature for some years until poor form and fitness led to him being dropped in favor of sarfaraz ahmed

in 16 tests umar made 1003 runs with one century and six fifties while in 121 odis he has 3194 runs with two centuries the best being 102 not out

in 84 t20 internationals akmal has made 1690 runs with the highest score of 94 and eight halfcenturies to his name ; leeds might not be the only team lacking a key player on saturday

leeds united will be looking to bounce back from saturdays 10 defeat at home to wigan against promotion rivals nottingham forest on saturday

sabri lamouchis men have been in good form recently gradually closing the gap behind leeds in recent weeks although they failed to capitalise on uniteds loss at the weekend letting an early lead slip and being defeated 21 at birmingham

marcelo bielsas whites have now lost three of their last four matches in the league while another defeat in saturdays early evening kickoff at the city ground could see fulham move level on points with leeds having enjoyed an 11point lead shortly before christmas

it would also see forest and potentially brentford and bristol city all move within two points of leeds by the end of the weekend

kalvin phillips serves the last of a threematch suspension for the trip while adam forshaw isnt expected to return to midfield but how are the opposition shaping up

injuries

tendayi darikwa

the zimbabwe international who can player either on the right wing or at rightback is the clubs only longterm injury concern

he suffered an anterior cruciate ligament injury in preseason and remains out for the foreseeable future theres no chance hell be back for this one although with an original sixmonth absence diagnosed he could potentially have a role to play in the runin for forest

samba sow

the forest faithful will no doubt be sweating on the fitness of sow who has been an integral part of their strong campaign this season featuring in the midfield engine room alongside ben watson when fit

he missed saturdays 21 defeat at birmingham and generally their offdays tend to coincide with his absences their points per game ratio dramatically falling when hes not in the team

only hulls kevin stewart averages more tackles in the championship this season and his influence is arguably comparable to that of kalvin phillips at leeds

but it was just a knock that kept him out and lamouchi is hopeful hell return for saturday

he had a problem with his knee and we cant play with players not at 100 percent said the forest chief

i dont think it is serious i hope it is not serious i hope he will be ready for the next game

suspensions

forest currently have no players suspended with no players in their squad receiving more than six bookings to date and just one red card back in november ; all the apps and fitness trackers push you to do 10000 steps a day come rain or shine if you want to be your fittest you  but it turns out the number may have just been a marketing gimmick

the 10k steps trend can be traced back to 1965 japan a doctor named yoshiro hatano began selling a pedometer known as the manpokei 10000 steps meter walk 10000 steps a day he said and you can consider yourself fit

now legend has it he may have picked the number because the japanese symbol for 10k looks like a walking man

there is no evidence to suggest that 10000 is any kind of turning point for fitness if anything the catchphrase has done quite a lot of harm since people began to feel that if there was no chance of them hitting 10000 they neednt bother to walk about for exercise at all

that is simply not the case says fitness and health coach deanne pandey  there is no onesizefitsall number of steps to aim for

for a fit 20yearold 10000 steps might be too few and for a 69yearold with arthritis it might be too much the trend ignores heart rate during exercise and even the intensity of the walking if youre ambling about and hitting 10000 steps it doesnt really count as a workout pandey adds the important thing is to get the heart racing and to move as much as you can

every little bit helps pandey emphasises but the truth is that exercise is exercise and the best form is cardiovascular

so forget the random number and do as many steps as you can its a start even if it is not in itself a solution ; how many times have you completed your workout without stretching which is due to lack of time or because you may not be aware of the importance of it many recreational athletes make this mistake it is an important part of training before and after it begins

it is necessary not only for those who play sports but also for those who sit a lot and do not move enough one of the best things you will accomplish by doing it is that you will increase your flexibility greater flexibility of your muscles will reduce the risk of joint ligament bone and muscle injury

do not worry too much about how long you will be in a stretching position but focus on relaxing your muscles and resetting them to their normal elongation at rest which usually takes between 530 seconds for each muscle

as a general rule stretching should not be too much effort and you should try to relax as much as possible while breathing deeply while doing it

for maximum effect it is important to know how why and when to do that some of the most important goals are

 it prevents muscle pain as well as cramps

 it reduces the possibility of muscle fatigue in the coming days  delayed onset muscle soreness

it serves to stretch the muscles while the body is at rest it consists of various techniques that gradually stretch the muscle to a certain extent  to the point of maximum muscle elongationcontraction  and not beyond it the feeling should be like a slight tightness but not pain hold that position for 1530 seconds then move to another muscle group while holding your posture you may feel warm or mild muscle discomfort

it activates specialized receptors for stretching muscles when done properly it lowers the sensitivity threshold of these receptors allowing the muscles to relax and then stretch to a greater length if you have an injury or are recovering do not work in the area to make the situation worse

it is performed at the end of the training and not at the beginning as it can reduce the strength of the muscles

dynamic is similar to static in range of motion but not in speed of execution this is where the muscles accelerate from the contracted to the stretched position and back making sure that the range of motion is not exceeded as in static dynamic gives slightly weaker effects than static but it is excellent as a kind of warmup and is highly recommended in those moments if this range of motion is crossed then the dynamic becomes ballistic

ballistically forces the leg or arm to enter the highest load dynamic mode when the muscle is objectively not relaxed enough to perform it this involves fast movements at the very physical limit of the movement ballistic is very dangerous and increases the risk of injury it is by no means recommended for recreational and beginner but not even experienced athletes without the help of experts only elite athletes who know their bodies to the point with the supervision of their trainers are able to perform them properly the advantages of this method over others are also debatable

therefore it is much better to go with the hyperbolic type of stretching as it is much safer a healthy point of view made an excellent review of this type and therefore we wont address it here just head out and check it yourself

it actively eliminates force and its effects from muscle stretching but first two terms agonism and antagonism  these are two opposite concepts and in our case they relate that one muscle counteracts the other such as arm twisting so while one muscle contracts agonism the other slows it down antagonism the force acting on the muscle stimulates it to activate the protective reflex and contract it this applies when one muscle antagonizes another and this type does not have any particular advantage over static usually the arm muscles antagonize the leg muscles at the cooldown phase

isometric is a form of static where there is practically no movement in the joints because isometric implies that the muscle has the same length during stretching this may sound paradoxical because the muscle is stretching and stretching is zero this means that there must be the same antagonistic force or resistance so that the result is zero that force is in the form of pushing an object an obstacle of course in a static form so the range of motion is not used here as in other stretching modes but force cancels movement combining isometric with other methods is best especially with static

here are some other things to do before and after your workout

hydration  it is unnecessary to talk about how important water is if not the most important fluid to your health it has been proven that the recommended daily intake is about 25l of water or 8 glasses heres a little trick if you spend 8 hours or more at work keep bottled water on the table so you can only make yourself drink water you will see  the habit is a miracle hydration regenerates muscles provides energy for training and improves the performance of your body

proper nutrition  yes nutrition is always important if not the most important factor in every segment of your lifestyle it is indisputable that 80 of healthy living consists of proper nutrition while the rest is related to exercise positive thoughts and spirit

massage  always beneficial and relaxing if you cant get used to relaxing before your workout you can always treat yourself to a onehour relaxing massage that will essentially be a replacement for the medications or preparations you are used to after a hard workout

so the rules are clear warmup dynamic stretching before training and be sure to stretch static after training and you will quickly feel the positive effects ; st johns antigua cmc  lefthanded strokemakers evin lewis and shimron hetymyer have been axed for this months oneday international tour of sri lanka after failing cricket west indies new fitness standards

allrounder rovman powell who averaged 58 with two exhilarating hundreds and fifties during the super50 has also earned a recall following 14 months on the sidelines while leftarm spinning allrounder fabian allen returns following injury

sacramento calif ap  california gov gavin newsom wants to pause physical education tests for students for three years due to concerns over bullying and the test discriminating against disabled and nonbinary students the move also comes after annual test results show a growing percentage of students scoring not healthy

hd palmer spokesman for the department of finance said the state has received complaints that the current examinations measurement of body mass index is discriminatory to nonbinary students a measurement calculated from weight and height bmi screenings require students to select male or female he said

annual state reports of the fitness test since the 20142015 school year show a steady decline in the share of students scoring healthy according to a review by the associated press students scores have particularly dropped in the category of the fitness test that measures aerobic capacity  which can be tested in a onemile run or by other methods other categories also test for flexibility and exercises like pushups

in the last five years the percentage of fifth graders scoring healthy in the aerobic category has dropped by 33 percentage points in seventh and ninth grades the drops are 44 percentage points and 38 percentage points respectively meanwhile the percentage of students identified as needing improvement and having a health risk went up by 33 percentage points among fifth graders 44 for seventh graders and 38 among ninth graders

physical education classes would remain a requirement for graduation however

katelyn is no stranger to showing off skin not too long ago she recently sent temperatures soaring in another steamy lingerie set that left little to the imagination ; lefthanders shimron hetmyer and evin lewis could find themselves in with a chance of redemption shortly after failed fitness assessments ruled them out of this months oneday tour of sri lanka

cricket west indies chief executive johnny grave revealed monday that fitness assessments were conducted on a biannual basis with the next one scheduled for june but players who failed assessments could also be reappraised

in our strength and conditioning policy theyre tested twice every year obviously players will be retested if they fail grave said

the next testing is due in june players have to be at a minimum standard in order to be considered for selection

in announcing the 15man squad for the sri lanka series on monday chief selector roger harper said both hetmyer and lewis had come up short in the fitness test

he added hetmyer appeared to be getting his act together and was an integral part of the teams batting group

if hetmyer was forced to wait until june for the second fitness assessment he would almost certainly miss out on west indies threetest tour of england from june 429

the 23yearold has been a fixture in the test squad ever since making his debut two and a half years ago playing 16 matches and hitting five halfcenturies

both he and lewis featured in the ireland series last month with contrasting success but then failed fitness tests conducted last week by windies mens team strength and conditioning coach ronald rogers and cwis sports science and medicine manager dr oba gulston

lewis emerged as man of theseries following the ireland odis but hetmyer was dropped after failing in the two opening matches in bridgetown though he retained his spot for the three t20 internationals which followed

and with west indies set to undertake a hectic itinerary this year  including the t20 world cup in october  both players will be under pressure to prove their fitness under the new minimum requirements

grave said the fitness assessments were a critical component of the selection process and stressed the importance of players meeting the required standards

the fitness tests do two things one it makes sure that you fit the minimum standards required for selection the other one is that every player has a personal target to hit the englishman explained

if you miss your personal target you can be fined two weeks wages so there are two elements to the fitness tests

in terms of injuries players will conduct what is called a returntoplay policy so the medical screenings are for players who are carrying injuries separately

as such leftarm spinner fabian allen and lefthanded batsman nicholas pooran  both of whom recovered from recent injuries to be included in the odi squad to sri lanka  did not undergo the recent fitness assessments ; gabby allen shared a hot new update to her instagram page to show her 11 million fans how she plans on spending this upcoming valentines day

despite or maybe because of a widely mocked viral ad in which a man buys a peloton bike for his wife who seems to fear him sales continue to grow and customer reviews remain positive

six months ago peloton had a massive hiring surge with the opening of its field operations division comprising employees tasked with delivery and inhome installation it quickly became pelotons most indemand job category as the company prepared for the giftgiving season

but its february the christmas lights are coming down the peloton wives are a month into their new workout routines and the job postings have fallen off

this 58 decline in all job listings is likely due to the decrease in field operations listings the oncedominant division has become 98 smaller since just last month now retail and software are pelotons top two hiring categories its also worth noting the growth of the studio observations job category

as we predicted almost a year ago this restructuring indicates pelotons interest in becoming the netflix of fitness with its own subscriptionbased exercisefocused streaming service offering over 300 new shows per week although theres no data on this yet we wouldnt bet on peloton and chill as the next big trend

unlike running or cycling which are pretty straightforward with weights everyone does their own thing different exercises different reps and sets different weights

but try not to be dissuaded weight training has so many benefits and is something i encourage almost everyone to add to their fitness routine at some point no matter what their goals so i wanted to break it down giving you a nice intro on how to structure a programme that relates to your goals

read more the lighthouse film review robert pattinson and willem dafoe shine in this tale of madness at sea

with weight training its important to get the basics right first and then work your way up you might spot some fancy lad in a unitard hurling a barbell into the air but unless youre determined to injure yourself its best to leave that kind of thing for the time being

crucially the mind and body have to work together  even if youre physically strong if you havent trained your mind to adapt to new movements with heavy weights you wont make any progress your body needs to adapt and your joints have to get stronger and that takes time and practice

you also need structure to your routines if youre walking into the weights section with no idea what youre about to lift then youre probably doing it all wrong here are some examples to get you started

weight training can be broken down into a number of components but im going to look at three today endurance hypertrophy and strength

 sets 12 reps 12

 suitable for beginners those recovering from injuries those training for endurance sports such as running or cycling general fitness and fat loss

you need to get your body acclimated to resistance training by doing lighter weight and higher reps the number of times you perform each individual lift going too heavy too quickly increases your chance of injury even if you find the high repetitions a little boring and are tempted to go heavier and do fewer resist the urge

high reps teaches your body a movement pattern and the more you do the more your body can adapt not only are you conditioning your muscles joints and tissues youre also teaching your nervous system a new trick a few weeks of performing high reps with relatively light weights will improve your joint health and increase blood flow to these areas helping to mobilise your joints and increase your range of motion the more you move the more you improve

weight selection should be a score of 56 out of 10 where 10 is the heaviest you could lift for a single rep and you shouldnt be reaching failure ie you should reach your target of 12 reps

focus on training the whole body rather than individual muscle groups select six to eight exercises including presses squats pulls and hinges

endurance training will help improve your fitness levels burn lots of calories and if you dont have much weight training experience you will soon get stronger with practice

 sets 36 reps 812

 suitable for those with some experience of weight training fat loss and building muscle training for aesthetics

hypertrophy is my favourite area to train as you can start noticing some visible changes to your body your muscles will feel and look better and if you are looking to lose weight this is a great place to be as you will expend a lot of energy

aside from looking good adding muscle to your frame has lots of benefits to your health and performance this could be just a couple of kilos to a serious amount of mass

when you start training most of your strength gains will be neuromuscular which is the brain and body working together as described above once youve made it past a certain point your body is no longer able to adapt like it once did and you need to focus on strength building muscle and tissues at a more structural level this is where you can start to play around with exercises and weights

without proper nutrition you will not be able to add muscle so hypertrophy also gets our clients paying more attention to their food intake its difficult to build real muscle without feeding it but if you overfeed the body its easy to put on weight striking the right balance is crucial

when it comes to exercise selection there are countless options some people prefer to train specific muscle groups in each session and some people prefer to do a full body approach the key is to add volume to each area over time and i encourage my clients to aim for around 18 sets per week on each muscle weights should be around 67 out of 10 and its ok to go to failure keep your rest time around 6090 seconds between each exercise

 sets reps 16

 suitable for specific sports strength related goals

strength is next stage up the ladder and this is more for advanced trainers if you havent trained before or are just getting back into training going in at this level will put too much stress on your muscles joints and nervous system lose your ego and earn your stripes first

this type of training is about maxing out and puts a high amount of stress through your body the heavier the loads the more important it is to focus on technique as the risk of injury goes up

strict strength training will be more about neuromuscular gains which means you will not expect to see much mass being added rather your muscles will get stronger some weightlifters will stay in the same weight category for most of their careers which means they are not adding mass just getting stronger

you may have heard of the one rep max test this basically sees how much you can lift in a single rep and its a great tool to set out the rest of your strength program based on the results

if you are training in this zone and attempting heavy lifts make sure you have someone spotting to help if you fail theres nothing worse than having a bench press go wrong and being pinned to the bench  at best its embarrassing and at worst it can kill you

focus on the big compound lifts such as deadlifts bench presses squats rows lunges and vertical presses you dont need to over complicate things  these core movements should be enough to see most people through a successful strength regime

remember to listen to your body and dont feel like you have to work at 100 per cent some days you might feel invincible others youll be inexplicably weak just ride those waves and youll make progress towards your goals ; the west indies on monday dropped key batsmen evin lewis and shimron hetmyer for their upcoming oneday international series against sri lanka saying the pair failed to meet new minimum fitness requirements

west palm beach fla prweb february 03 2020

the t2 isotrainer a portable and uncompromising fitness device launched on kickstarter today the new workout tool provides the most comprehensive and dynamic workout experience that saves time by working users harder and faster than any other device available no matter when they opt to workout or where they happen to be the t2 isotrainer combines over ten training methods  isokinetic isometric isoelastic suspension plyometric bungee aerobic flexibility functional and hiit into one system so the user can move freely from one exercise to the next without ever letting go of the handles or changing bands or plates

creating a career blueprint can help you determine the type of career that you want to pursue and outline the steps that you must take to reach your career goals a blueprint helps you see the importance of and think more concretely about career development blueprints are designed to help you manage your career more effectively and to enable you to realize your potential career blueprints not only help students or those in the early stages of their career but also can help those who have been in the workforce for a longer time think about the next phase of their career

the first step in creating a career blueprint is to identify the type of position you wish to pursue in the exercise science field there are many considerations within this category you might consider what type of setting you wish to work in  clinical performance or health fitness what type of clients or patients do you enjoy working with for example do you prefer children adults or older adults do you wish to help improve the performance of athletes help deconditioned adults or work with patients who need close monitoring you also want to consider what types of work functions you enjoy perhaps you want to be in a managerial position where you have supervisory responsibilities perhaps having a position with direct client or patient contact is important to you think about what you value in a career and think about the characteristics that you dont want for example are you someone who does not want to sit at a desk all day

as you think more clearly about the direction that you want to take with your career it is very helpful to consider practical issues such as compensation hours and travel requirements determine what you want and what you dont want learn as much as you can about the career path that you are considering and talk with professionals who are already in the field i was speaking recently with a 30yearold woman with a bs in exercise science who loves to work with athletes she was considering an ms degree in athletic training with the goal of working as an athletic trainer at a university however after talking with practicing athletic trainers and shadowing them for a few days she realized that hours many nights and weekends and the travel schedule would not be feasible because she is a single parent with two small children she is now considering a strength and conditioning career focusing on young athletes

the next phase of the career blueprint is defining the path that you need to take to meet your career goals identify the knowledge and skills you need to move forward in your career and ask yourself if you have the necessary education to achieve your goals you may find that you need more training andor skill development depending on your goals you may need more education in some aspect of exercise science also you may benefit from more training or experience in other areas such as web design public speaking or business

the opportunities to learn new information and develop additional skills that will help with career development are countless earning a degree or advanced degree opens up many opportunities for securing a new professional position or advancing within your current employment acsm offers credentials such as the certified cancer exercise trainer and the clinical exercise physiologist association offers webinars several times each year for advanced training in working with special populations many colleges and universities offer postbaccalaureate certificates often with an online component that can provide you with new skills be strategic in your selection of courses and programs its always good to learn new things but keep your blueprint in mind so that you select courses that will help you reach your career goals it also is beneficial to consider how the field of exercise science will develop during the next 5 to 10 years as this can be incorporated into your blueprint and put you ahead of the curve when it comes to marketable skills for example will the changing demographics in the united states offer new opportunities for working with older adults if so you may consider a postbaccalaureate certificate in gerontology from a college or university will the affordable care act provide more opportunities for referrals from physicians and other health care providers especially to individuals who have the exercise is medicine credential

once you have a clear picture of the type of career you want to pursue you should maximize your value by identifying and developing the skills that will help you succeed teaching and coaching skills often are an important component in our profession even if you begin by teaching something that is not related directly to exercise science it will help you develop communication skills and become more proficient in understanding how people learn for example if you are a good cook offer a basic cooking class at your local community center

consider the following example robert was not sure what to do with his life so he became a personal trainer immediately after high school because he enjoyed sports he found that he loved helping people improve their fitness and after thoroughly researching the field and creating a career blueprint decided he wanted a career in corporate fitness to reach his goal robert concluded that he needed to earn a bs degree in exercise science and become acsmhfs certified although it will take robert 4 to 5 years to reach these milestones there are many things that he can do along the way that will help him achieve his longterm goal the ability to teach group exercise classes is an important skill robert could learn to teach group exercise at the campus recreation center and become certified making him more marketable when he earns his degree he could take additional courses in health promotion as this often is an important responsibility of the corporate fitness staff taking small but significant steps along the way will contribute to roberts success in corporate fitness

mentors are an important resource for creating and implementing your career blueprint individuals with experience in your field of interest can provide you with invaluable advice about how to be successful you can learn from their experiences and their career journey cultivating alliances and advisers is important because you dont succeed alone do not be shy about reaching out to potential mentors most individuals who have successful careers enjoy helping younger professionals navigate through the early part of their career attend conferences that will put you in touch with potential mentors the acsm regional chapter meetings are an ideal place to network with leaders in the field of exercise science

when you create your career blueprint be honest with yourself taking your strengths and weaknesses into account consider the knowledge and skills that you have and identify those which you need to improve it can be difficult to think about your weaknesses but just knowing what they are will make you more selfaware if this is hard for you you can ask a family member or close friend to describe your strengths and weaknesses and give you reasons for the description keep in mind that many of your strengths are transferable were you the captain of a sports team or did you hold an office in a club or organization even though you werent an exercise leader per se the leadership skills that you developed will help with many career choices

many people find that thinking about their career choices is stressful a career blueprint offers a gentle and organized method to plan where you want to go and what it will take to get there simply knowing the steps that you need to take can make career planning much more enjoyable ; newswirenet  february 3 2020  doral fl  f45 training doral announces the launch of its fitness challenge in february 2020 this challenge will extend for a duration of 8 weeks and is a comprehensive and focused fitness plan that includes workouts nutrition plans and community support

yet that initial motivation often fizzles out as february creeps up sometimes you need a life coachs journey to help inspire that motivation

during our interview i asked sandy what made her decide to get into fitness sandys passion for fitness began during her time in high school being on the cross country and soccer teams

i always enjoyed how my coaches would motivate me to do better and want to be a better version of myself than i was yesterday

sandy continued

so i feel like in that sense i always got this social aspect of wanting to help other people or help them recognize that they can eventually do it on their own

sandy is well aware of the misconceptions people have about wellness and fitness she lists several phenomena that her clients and the population at large often experience she mentions fad diets but also cleanses as unreliable and unsustainable wellness practices

people see this as oh i need to go on this juice cleanse or a glutenfree cleanse and then two weeks later theyre eating everything they have in the fridge

instead sandy recommends moderation when it comes to healthy eating

dont cut anything out unless you have an allergy

lin also explained how viewing wellness as a singular challenge or goal to overcome once can be hurtful and lead people to these oneanddone cleanse fixes and strict monthlong diets

instead sandy recommends viewing fitness and wellness more like a marathon not a short term diet

the former athlete knows that it can be difficult to stay on track and even more difficult if you havent worked out for several years

the energy and mental capacity that comes with that its not easy to start for people who havent worked out in 810 years and then now theyre making a complete life switch

her approach is to establish herself as a life coach rather than just a better fitness influencer sandy shared some of the conversations she starts off with when meeting clients

like okay you have these habits but we can work on them

sandy explained that as a life coach she also places a big emphasis on selfimage and provides practical plans to achieve both better health and wellness habits as well as positively affecting selfimage

i have some clients who think very negatively about their bodies and im starting to help them realize and transition into having a positive body image of themselves and really envision down the line what full selflove feels like

sandy continued

working incrementally like this month were going to help you build two pounds of muscle and they look back on their pictures from last month and theyre like oh wow theres a difference

sandy is well aware that exercise and eating well are not behaviors that exist within a vacuum mental health is a crucial piece of our day to day decision making and motivations

the fitness trainer recognizes that people often place work as their primary focus and unfortunately become so stressed that finding the time and motivation to work out and actively eat well can be difficult

i have some clients that have dedicated 1020 yrs to their work and now they have health issues because they didnt sort it out when it was a small problem

she herself as experienced this stress as a professional trainer in her previous job sandy was a trainer at a big fitness corporation she felt the environment was too competitive to fit her purpose

she was working from 5 am to 9 or 10 pm on most days this went on for over six months and sandy was getting burnt out

i think its all about kind of finding your own niche or purpose like who are you trying to help and why are you trying to help them whats your purpose in your occupation

after realizing she was in a negative space she decided to take time off to refresh and quit that job

and now the place i work its my own pace my own schedule

after reevaluating what was most important to sandy in her career she found a job that aligned with that she shared some advice to trainers or really anyone who feels stuck in a job that they dont feel is for them

i would recommend for people to realize why theyre doing what theyre doing what purpose do they serve what value do they think they can bring to their occupation that theyre in

sandy also emphasized the power of saying no as upandcoming professionals we feel we need to take advantage of every opportunity that comes our way

but sandy points out that you cannot give your energy and focus on too many opportunities at once

if i have 10 opportunities i cant say yes to all of them because im gonna burn myself out i have to figure out which one is the most timeefficient costefficient and i can show up and be present for my clients

some of these opportunities extend beyond being a fitness and wellness influencer sandy is also a model i asked her how she ended up juggling so many roles

i always knew that i was going to do different things and have different roles i know that i enjoy this and how can i do all of it and try to do it well

sandys favorite part about having multiple jobs is its flexibility something her previous job seriously lacked her least favorite part is the uncertainty

finding a good worklife balance is important but within that you must find a good exercise balance burn out can happen with working out too

the general rule is dont do too much sandy considered doing powerlifting or intense bodybuilding for her workouts

still she decided against it because although those are good workouts your body will reach capacity and its not sustainable as a long term practice into late adulthood

i wanted something sustainable for my everyday life and so now i work out 34x a week and i also take classes and do yoga when i get the chance

sandy continued

i think it took me a while to come to that point where i was like oh i dont need to work out six times a week i can work out three or four times a week and still feel like it was a productive week

getting that basic workout in can dramatically change your mood mental clarity and new energy blooms sandy has seen this with both herself and clients

my clients tell me wow i have so much energy now my mental capacity is altered its widened because of all the energy i have

sandys advice for those looking to make the lifestyle switch into a healthy and fit routine is separated into three easy to digest questions

1 what are your healthy and unhealthy habits and come to terms with these habits

2 can you exchange one bad habit for another good habit you practice

3 whats an action plan you can create for this habit

when it comes to taking action on changing these habits sandy says you dont need to do 10 of them at once you dont even need to do three of them at once just do one

one thing to keep in mind  be kind to yourself sandy says even if you mess up just dont beat yourself up and then just keep living and working out

the overall message is to start small and keep it pushing despite any obstacles its a marathon not a sprint ; its not a herd mentality  where everyone jumps on a trend to be seen as a part of it for hyderabadis being fit and healthy is top priority now  a regular fitness routine has become a part of their daily life

for actress and fitness enthusiast rakul preet singh who has several videos of her gym workout sessions doing the rounds on the internet fitness became a part of her life since her childhood

being an army kid i was exposed to a lot of sports and outdoor activities after i started playing golf eventually modelling and the film industry took over but working out has remained an essential part of my daily routine says rakul adding that besides an hourlong session of workout for six days in a week she also likes to shock her system with highintensity workouts

but rakul isnt surprised with the fitness trend around her too the shift from eating junk to getting fit has been evident for the past five years with people getting more aware of healthy living health is now a bigger picture in hyderabad than it used to be it is about the right energy level and improving immunity and the tolerance to pollution moreover it adds well that the city has many resources available for the citizens to adopt fitness as their lifestyle and to lead a healthy life she says adding if my workout videos change at least ones outlook also those posts are worth it

rishitha a team leader at an mnc is one among those who follows actor rakuls workout videos besides actors samantha and pragyas

her main reason for joining a gym was to maintain her fitness and health and also to begin a disciplined routine

i noticed that a wellplanned routine helps in creating a perfect and longerlasting lifestyle change she opines she sets aside a budget of 7000 for four months excluding her postworkout diet sharing her routine she adds i choose to work out in the evening slot after office hours so that i can focus on my diet and sleeping hours i also have fitness apps that help me with the little things such as reminding me to drink water walking while i am talking on the phone etc

waking up to discipline

sharath tata a graphic designer at a startup says he started believing that waking up early makes the day perfect while i always felt i lacked discipline the goodold traditional quote waking up early is healthy and turns you productive and punctual helped me i took on a 100day walking challenge and when that ended i joined the gym the difference in my lifestyle and health routine were perceptible chips in sharath he feels the increasing number of fitness centres in the city shows that this generation is quite sensitive about health and fitness thanks to their awareness on the topic also the possibility of flexiworking hours startup culture and workfromhome policies make it easier for more people to dedicate time to their health and working out in the gym he adds

walking into wellbeing

talla bhasker who owns a fitness centre in the city with an approximate strength of 500 members in it is not surprised that the city ranks fourth with regard to fitness being healthconscious and making gym yoga exercise workouts a lifestyle need have always been important but the increase in the number of fitness centres and more trends showing up in the city are only natural given the increase in health issues here all of which are triggered by ninehour workshifts reduced bodily movements increased intake of junk food and irregular food habits he says in his gym bhasker notes that while the youngsters usually skip their sessions those in their 30s and above take fitness seriously while members come in to train for their own reasons including fitness bodybuilding and health issues according to him most prefer time slots either between 6 and 10 in the morning or 5 and 830 in the evening ; anita herbert posted a new update to her instagram account to show off her bubble butt to encourage her 21 million fans to participate in a giveaway of one of her workout guides that focuses on the booty

raheem sterling faces a fitness race to be ready in time for manchester citys champions league clash with real madrid

the england international was substituted in the final minutes of citys 20 defeat at tottenham on sunday holding his hamstring

sterling is set for scans in the coming days to discover the extent of the injury with the last16 trip to the bernebeu stadium coming up at the end of the month

more teams

the 25yearold is likely to miss the premier league clash with west ham on sunday which is followed by a twoweek winter break before a trip to leicester

sterling was already due to a rest from first team action during that break with pep guardiola deciding to give his players time off rather than go for warm weather training in abu dhabi as they have done in previous years

the city boss said that he thought it would be beneficial for the players to relax and spend time with their families rather than focus on the champions league clash with madrid

sterling has been one of the most influential players for guardiola this season playing more minutes than anyone other than kevin de bruyne and already hitting 20 goals  the third successive season he has reached that landmark

however the goals have dried up in recent weeks with the former liverpool forward failing to find the back of the net this year  a run stretching back eight games and forming his worst goalless streak since 2017

sterlings absence could be offset by the return of leroy sane as the german winger steps up his recovery from the knee injury that ruled him out since the community shield victory over liverpool in august

sane was involved in firstteam training on monday and will increase his activity over the coming days with the possibility that he could play a part in the next few weeks however city will be cautious with his recovery to ensure there are no setbacks

the former tottenham hotspur midfielder joined inter for around 169m last month after reaching the final six months of his spurs contract

speaking to sky italia after the match conte said i think that for someone who arrived five days ago and we should not forget we had to rush him in because we were missing several midfielders eriksen still made a positive impact

obviously he needs to get settled into our style of football and also find the right fitness levels for serie a but i am very pleased with his full debut

the san siro side won the match 20 thanks to two secondhalf goals from belgian striker romelu lukaku

the result leaves inter second in the serie a table just three points adrift of leaders juventus

the fitness coach and her daughter began the gruelling hike on january 28 and successfully reached the 4095metre high peak after 19 hours

siti aminah is now hoping that sofia can potentially earn a spot in the malaysian book of records as the youngest person to reach mount kinabalus summit

in a series of facebook posts she shared her experience of conquering the tallest mountain in the malay archipelago with a young child in tow and the challenges they faced including unpredictable weather with temperatures dipping as low as two degrees celsius

the journey wasnt easy but this is a memory that will last a lifetime

thankfully everything went smoothly and throughout the journey sofia didnt make a fuss and she occasionally walked on her own without needing to be carried the whole time wrote siti aminah

to combat the cold siti aminah made sure to wrap her daughter up in four layers of sweaters and trousers that kept her warm and snug

after receiving backlash from some social media users who thought the climb was too risky for a child of sofias age siti aminah clarified that they were accompanied by a guide and a doctor all the way

for those asking about sofias safety we did not go alone

i was with a doctor who made sure sofia was okay and he helped us along the journey

before embarking on the mission siti aminah said she put herself through a twoday training course at bukit maragang in kundasang sabah to prepare herself for the challenge

she described the path to mount kinabalus peak as a neverending flight of stairs that almost made her want to give up

when i looked up at those stairs i almost wanted to cry

i asked god what am i doing here i should just be staying at home and relaxing

but sofia she made everything easier she didnt say she wanted to go back once nor did she throw a tantrum ; manchester city are confident raheem sterling will be available for their champions league clash with real madrid despite suffering a hamstring injury during the defeat to tottenham sources have told espn

sterling limped off with a hamstring strain during the 20 defeat on sunday and is set to miss citys next fixture west hams visit to the etihad stadium

the england winger is also a doubt for the game against leicester at the king power stadium on feb 22 at the end of citys winter break but the injury should not keep him out of the champions league roundof16 first leg against real madrid at the bernabeu on feb 26

manager pep guardiola has admitted sterling who has already played 40 games this season is suffering from fatigue but club medical staff consider the 25yearold to be a quick healer and at this stage there are no fears he will miss the game against zinedine zidanes side in three weeks time

meanwhile city are interested in villarreal defender pau torres as they prepare to rejuvenate guardiolas squad over the summer

 premier league winter break all you need to know

the hierarchy led by director of football txiki begiristain have identified the centre of defence as a key area to strengthen ahead of next season and torres 23 could be one of two centrebacks to arrive

vincent kompanys departure in the summer has led to midfielder fernandinho spending most of the campaign in defence while there are also doubts over the futures of nicolas otamendi and john stones

stones 25 has endured a difficult season and despite being on the verge of entering the final two years of his contract there are no plans yet to discuss an extension ; north eastbased elite together is a fitness community changing clients lives mindsets and delivering results envied by their competitors

if one of your new years resolutions was to kick your fitness game up a notch then give it a boost with one of 2020s hottest work out trends

after all its about this time in february that our resolutions begin to fall by the wayside

so an injection of something new is just whats needed to keep you on track and keep your exercise regime interesting

here are 6 fitness trends worth checking out

1 at home training

get your fitness game on from the comfort of your own home

theres no need to join an expensive gym or battle the cold and rain to ensure you work up a sweat

thanks to online classes both free and subscription based you can now access all kinds of training styles on your laptop smartphone or tablet and enjoy them all in the comfort of your living room

you wont necessarily need any equipment and there will be classes that specifically dont need any props but if you really get into it then you might want to invest in a few items like a yoga mat weights bands and an inflatable balance ball to get the most out of your work outs

2 group training

sometimes its great to go for a run or an exercise class on our own its a great way to get some alone time and can be a meditation in itself taking our minds off our never ending to do list

but in 2020 think about working out in a group whether you organise a gang of friends or work colleagues or whether you take part in one of the new group work outs designed specifically for troops youll find the presence of others will bring out your competitive spirit pushing you to further personal bests

3 yoga

take care of yourself with restorative yoga practices

yoga isnt technically new in fact this practice is ancient

but in 2020 its having a resurgence as we move from hardcore high intensity work outs to an approach thats more about overall wellness and recovery

and thats where yoga comes in whichever style you choose to follow and there are quite a few the poses and clear focus yoga encourages will help to calm the body and mind

and if youre in need of some serious unwinding then search out a yin yoga class which is all about slow long held poses and stretches

just dont be surprised if you fall asleep

4 all day in every way

this is all about making the most of every opportunity to get active

and its as simple as taking the stairs instead of the lift walking up escalators getting off your public transport one or two stops early and walking the rest of the way getting into gardening getting up from your desk regularly to walk around the office and even putting extra effort into cleaning the house

everyday activities like these are like stealth work outs youll barely notice youre doing them but theyre great ways to keep moving

5 dance your way to fitness

dance dance dance your way to your fitness goals

exercise doesnt need to be a hard slog it can be fun and one of the most entertaining ways to work up a sweat is dancing

remember all those nights clubbing from dusk until dawn you never dreaded it or found it too exhausting so apply the same logic to your new fitness class

you can sign up to classic dance classes like street latin and tap or there are work outs that incorporate dancing as the cardio element too

plus youll learn a new skill so whats not to love

6 wellness getaways

weve all heard of yoga retreats but now there are bootcamp holidays across europe barre based breaks detox weekends and even surfing trips where you can not only have fun and meet new people but get active too

or book a walking holiday where you spend each day walking to the next overnight stop

youll be having so much fun you wont even notice that youre getting fit

activewear so good youll want to work out

a circular was published on jan 5 brta director lokman hossain mollah told bdnews24com

it took some time to upgrade the relevant software to accommodate the change he said

according to the circular the government will issue fiveyear fitness certificates for new cars jeeps and microbuses with options for renewal every two years

earlier the owners had to renew the fitness certificates for the vehicles every year ; the benefits of the fitness balls are numerous these balls are an excellent tool to improve cardio back and spine health strengthen the core muscle and better your body balance and posture he says

take the slam ball for example just like the name you slam it on the floor pick it up and repeat this is a very basic move but it engages your core muscles and works out your back and shoulder muscles additionally the movements increase your heartbeat increasing calorie burn imagine all this just by throwing a ball down repeatedly adding different variations to the slam ball like squats and burpees tones your legs and abs he says ; a deputy primary school principal teacher is the subject of a fitness to teach inquiry for possessing and distributing child pornography

brian fitzgerald of meadowlands youghal co cork is serving an 18month sentence after pleading guilty of one count of possessing child pornography and four counts of distributing child pornography on various dates between february and may 2017

fitzgerald did not appear at the inquiry on tuesday and did not have legal representation

however in previous correspondence with the teaching council his solicitor said he had held his hands up and pleaded guilty and was not contesting the inquiry or any evidence

the teaching councils disciplinary committee inquiry panel has powers to issue sanctions such as deregistering a teacher and applying an indefinite ban on teaching in a publicly funded school

the inquiry heard that gardaí first became became aware of the offence when it began investigating users accessing a child porn website

they identified one computer user who was using the name schoolteacher and traced the download to fitzgerald

gardaí raided his house on may 6th 2017 and seized computer equipment

they arrested fitzgerald but he denied possessing child pornography or knowing anything about child pornography and was released without charge

however gardaí sent the equipment for examination and garda cyber experts established that thousands of images and videos had been deleted from the computer

gardaí rearrested fitzgerald on june 25th 2018 for questioning and when questioned about the deleted images and videos he admitted they belonged to him

the inquiry heard that fitzgerald had downloaded 551 images and 1162 videos depicting children under 17 engaging in various sexual acts

and they also established that he had downloaded 529 images and 1018 videos depicting children under the age of 17 exposing their genitalia

some of these deleted images included female adults engaged in sexual activity with babies as well as preteen boys and girls involved in sexual activity with adults or other boys and girls

gardaí established that fitzgerald had shared some 53 child porn images on four separate dates with individuals in the uk us and germany and they were now being investigated by foreign police

the inquiry heard that fitzgerald had gone on sick leave from the school where he was teaching following his first arrest in 2017 and he later took a career break in 2018 and had not taught since

the teaching councils disciplinary committee inquiry panel is due to complete its hearing on tuesday and is likely to issue a finding

however teachers who are subject to the inquiry are not obliged to attend in person and may be represented by a union colleague or legal representative

during fitzgeralds court case last year his defence barrister pleaded for leniency pointing out that his client a single man had moved back into the family home in youghal and was caring for his elderly mother who has earlyonset alzheimers disease

however judge sean ó donnabháin said possession of child pornography was a serious offence but of even more concern to him were the distribution charges where he shared such images with others

he sentenced fitzgerald to three years in jail on the distribution charges and on the possession charge but he suspended the final 18 months to incentivise his rehabilitation while in prison ; aston villa injury latest  heres the very latest in terms of the injury table back at bodymoor heath while the likes of jack grealish and tyrone mings enjoy some sunshine

im not sure of the actual extent ive been told they are significant knee injuries so they will go and see the experts i wont go into the medical terminology of what theyve done ive just been told significant knee injury

weve just spoken and its out for the season thats all i need to know to be honest so i can start planning for the rest of this season ; bangladeshs wicketkeeperbatsman mushfiqur rahim passed the fitness test on tuesday february 4 and made himself available for the upcoming bangladesh cricket league

mushfiqur who opted out of the pakistan tour due to security reasons was ruled out from the opening round of the bcl and subsequently there was speculation that he might not be considered for the upcoming home series against zimbabwe who are due to arrive in february to play a oneoff test apart from two t20is and three odis

mushfiqur had a grade one hamstring injury and was going under a rehabilitation program we were expecting him to be available from the second week of february he has successfully passed the fitness test and is considered fit to take part in competitive cricket bcb chief physician debashish chowdhury told reporters after the fitness test at sherebangla national stadium on tuesday

when asked whether he will be considered for the home series against zimbabwe given that there is speculation that the team management is not ready to change the batting lineup in the upcoming tests national chief selector minhajul abedin told cricbuzz on tuesday that they are looking forward to see how he fares in the bcl game slated on february 7

let us see how he fares in the bcl game we havent said that we are not willing to take him but first he had to pass the fitness test which he did and now he will have to perform in the bcl game to make himself available for the home series against zimbabwe said minhajul

meanwhile imrul kayes also passed the fitness test to make him available for selection after having suffered a calf muscle injury that he sustained during the bangabandhu bangladesh premier league

debashish further added that they are likely to send test opener shadman islam and under19 pace bowler mrittunjoy chowdhury who returned from the icc under19 world cup for surgery

we were struggling to manage the injuries of shadman and mrittunjoy chowdhury who had returned from the under19 world cup with a shoulder injury the board has decided to send them both to australia for better treatment hopefully later this month debashish concluded ; plasmids  extrachromosomal replicons  can support rapid bacterial adaptation by moving genes between phylogenetically diverse bacteria a process known as horizontal gene transfer 1 this is particularly important in the case of antibiotic resistance where acquisition of plasmidborne antibiotic resistance genes args can instantly render a strain impervious to antibiotic treatment 2 the current global antibiotic resistance crisis has been largely attributed to plasmidmediated arg dissemination 3

strategies to combat the antibiotic resistance epidemic therefore require an understanding of the mechanisms that underlie plasmid fate in microbial communities upon entering a microbial community a plasmid will only persist if its original or secondary hosts transconjugants survive if it persists it will constitute a longterm reservoir of auxiliary genes for that community in fact persistence of incp1 plasmids and their derivatives has recently been observed in ex situ communities like anaerobic sludge microcosms 4 and an artificial multispecies system 5 over periods longer than 10 days as well as in murine gut microbiota experiments 6 however by simply interpreting plasmid persistence as the frequency of plasmid occurrence these observational studies did not explicitly examine the mechanisms that underlie plasmid persistence therefore we are currently far from able to predict plasmid fate in a microbial community

in contrast to our limited understanding of plasmid persistence at the community level the fate of plasmids at the population level has received much more attention there theoretical and empirical studies have demonstrated that the conditions for plasmid persistence are governed by the interplay of segregational loss conjugal transfer and the effect of the plasmid on host fitness 789 the rates of these processes depend on the plasmid the host and the environmental conditions in a complex manner first although partitioning mechanisms exist to ensure ordered plasmid segregation prior to cell division 10 plasmid loss during vegetative growth can typically be detected 7 second plasmid carriage often imposes a reduction in fitness to the host 11 therefore in the absence of mechanisms countering segregational loss and fitness cost plasmids would eventually be removed from bacterial populations to persist plasmids lacking stringent postsegregational killing systems thus depend on one or both of two mechanisms fitness cost amelioration and horizontal transfer 9

in the majority of longterm cultivation experiments plasmid persistence is associated with a reduction in the burden of plasmid carriage through adaptation mainly by compensatory mutations 9 this lessens selection against plasmid carriage and therefore reduces the rate at which plasmids are removed from the population for example by experimentally evolving pseudomonas fluorescens carrying a highfitnesscost plasmid harrison et al observed amelioration of the costofcarriage across a wide gradient of environmental conditions even without positive selection for plasmid carriage 12 in an evolutionary experiment conducted by dionisio et al 13 strong fitnessincrease effects were noted of conjugative plasmid r1 both in the original host escherichia coli and other bacterial lineages including salmonella enterica recent studies on the genetic basis underlying such adaptations among different plasmidhost pairs suggest that poor plasmid persistence can be caused by a high cost involving helicaseplasmid interactions which can be rapidly ameliorated 14 another explanation for plasmid persistence within a population is conjugal transfer in contrast to conjugationdeficient pkjk5 derivatives the ability of the original pkjk5 plasmid to conjugate played an essential role in its stable maintenance in populations of e coli and kluyvera sp 15 16 more recently lopatkin et al 17 experimentally demonstrated that transfer rate of common conjugative plasmids was necessary and sufficient to maintain plasmids in an e coli population

detailed investigations of plasmid fate have been limited to pure or defined cultures of isogenic or closely related strains of a few model species such research on species like e coli and p putida have confirmed the notion that plasmid persistence is strain dependent 181920 strains of p putida can differ largely in their ability to maintain the incp1 plasmid pb10 21 22 the cause of this interstrain variability is currently unknown and our ability to identify it is likely limited by the fact that testing single strains is labour intensive

since most bacteria exist within complex communities of hundreds to thousands of species plasmid persistence is ideally examined within this context however tracking the fate of a plasmid and its hosts within a complex community poses a great challenge populationlevel experiments ignore the complex interactions within communities which further prevents inferring plasmid fate in communities for example interspecies transfer enabled persistence of plasmid pqbr57 which would have been impossible within a single population 23 besides multilevel ecological dynamics play a role in a community since fitness differences do not only exist between plasmidfree and plasmidbearing cells within populations of a singular strain but also between strains therefore a plasmid can be lost because of low intrinsic fitness of its hosts or even merely because of ecological drift

previous work on community permissiveness ie the ability to take up a plasmid from an exogenous donor strain has revealed that incp1 plasmids can readily be transferred to diverse members of complex environmental communities 242526 however it is not clear to what extent the communities can maintain the plasmid and in which way the individual members can contribute to communitylevel plasmid persistence

by coupling permissiveness assays using a gfptagged plasmid with serial growth experiments we monitored the persistence of the incp1 plasmid pkjk5 not only at the community level but also at the level of individual phylotypes to identify the relative importance of the processes acting on plasmid persistence and how they vary across phylotypes to reduce complexity we chose conditions where conjugal transfer is limited and thus where segregational loss plasmid fitness effects and competition between phylotypes drive plasmid fate we identified that plasmid fitness benefits in multiple phylotypes played an essential role in communitylevel plasmid persistence ; burnout fitness is a boutique climbing gym that deploys the versaclimber for a high intensity low impact workout

one of the first studios to bring the versaclimber to the city burnout is a mix of cardio and hiit that leave you with a rush of adrenaline and sweat in a 60minute burn class

the versaclimber has been around since the 80s but it was recently popularized by los angeles trainer jason walsh who opened the popular studio rise nation stars like lebron james lady gaga and hilary duff swear by it

the versaclimber mimics the sensation of climbing a mountain and works both the upper and lower body the machine will move only as fast as you do with different levels of resistance and speed while measuring how many feet youve climbed

monica stajer the founder of burnout fitness and one of the citys elite trainers has been working with the versaclimber for five years and says its one of the best workouts available

apart from the health benefits the versaclimber is a zeroimpact workout a blessing for anyone with weak knees or achy joints but just because its easier on the body doesnt mean its an easier workout

the class is split into two parts  30minutes of floor work and 30minutes on the climber performing intervals  short bursts followed by long movements  ensures youre never bored

the class goes by incredibly fast leaving you extremely sweaty but completely energized theres a reason its called burnout because you need to give it your all theres little opportunity to be lazy in this class especially with a trainer like stajer who pushes you to do your best

the yonge street studio has one large room with 20 stations 10 climbers and 10 hiit stations with stall bars where you perform a variety of acrobatic feats in total the class incorporates hiit movements exercises on the stall bar and work on the versaclimber

the smaller classes mean more attention is given to each climber something i appreciated as i needed help setting up and understanding the climber it also means an attentive instructor who can adjust your form and watch for injuries something that larger studios dont focus on enough

in preparation for my first class i was told i would start to sweat within the first six minutes which i doubted i am after all supposed to be a fitness pro who sweats on the regular how tough can an upright machine be turns out it can be very tough

it was challenging leaving me with a burst of adrenaline bordering on addiction perhaps its the repetitive movements that get you into a good grove physically and mentally i couldnt wait to go back

burnout is not for the faint of heart it can be challenging to work in vertical motion with your arms above your head but its ideal for those who enjoy a maximum challenge and a new level of fun in their workout

the idea of an upright machine seems scary at first and it takes a few minutes to get the hang of but when you do it starts to become a natural rhythm in a single class you can climb anywhere from 34000 feet to put that into perspective the cn tower is 1800feet

a single burnout class is 30 first timers opt for the promo which gets you three classes for 45 ; governor holcomb and fitness icon jake steinfeld announced nominations are now open for indiana schools to apply for a 100000 dont quit fitness center from the national foundation for governors fitness councils nfgfc the nfgfc seeks to encourage and reward innovation in the field of youth fitness by awarding fitness centers to schools that use new and unique methods to promote student physical activity and wellness three indiana elementary or middle schools will each receive a 100000 stateoftheart fitness center from the nfgfc the nfgfc envisions a nation that  through innovation and a dont quit attitude  boasts the fittest kids in the world dont quit fitness centers have been built in 32 states and washington dc in 2020 nfgfc will gift fitness centers to four more states  indiana alabama kentucky and oklahoma  with a goal of building in all 50 states in the coming years

after displaying a slimmer physique and toner body toward the end of last year 51yearold andy cohen revealed he had made the decision to cut back on alcohol  a bold move for a latenight host who often drinks with his guests  after realizing his suits were getting tight he also said beach season was fast approaching and he didnt want to be that guy wearing the tshirt

though the bravo boss did admit to watching his diet in addition to abstaining from booze theres more to the story according to his personal trainer

theres a few things i can say about this ukraineborn stanislav stan kravchenko told toofab monday he became a dad so i think he prioritizes his health right now and fitness more than he used to he changed his nutrition he cut his carbs too and he did cut down on drinking

stan  whos on occasion bartended in the bravo clubhouse during cohens nightly watch what happens live  said he was actually sober for a full month before convincing andy to give it a shot

whats funny is i was doing a sober month and when i was doing the sober month i didnt drink any alcohol stan recalled and i was sharing with him listen i love it i have more energy its so good and he was like yeah yeah i will try it i will try it nows not a good time for me toward the end of stans sober month which he started in july 2019 andy saw the benefits and decided to begin his i remember the day because he was going on vacation and he wanted to look good on the beach he told us

once he started a whole month with no alcohol thats when he realized his body really he lost a lot of body fat and looked amazing stan said and then after that he was like im really thinking i should cut down on the alcohol because i dont see the point anymore i have a baby i have this i have that i look great i feel good

originally from eastern europe stan spent 10 years ages 5 to 15 practicing gymnastics then took on bodybuilding competitions though he studied communication systems in his home country he ultimately moved to the united states in 2010 to pursue his passion which was always fitness

once in new york stan did what he had to do to make ends meet all while doing what he loved he worked at mcdonalds with a moving company and as a security guard and ironically it was his first celebrity client  one of the higherups at the christian dior store on 57th avenue where he was working security  who suggested he pursue fitness full time

after taking classes at the national academy of sports medicine stan became certified in personal training five years ago he began his next chapter at equinox in greenwich village where he met andy the following year after training cohens friend pablo

pablo recommended andy to me and i didnt know who andy was i had no idea stan told us i am from ukraine i dont watch tv so that was funny meeting with him so he came and we finished the session and i said dont forget to pay for my session

stan said he and andy both quit equinox about a year ago hes my private client now he explained adding andy is i love him hes a super funny guy and super dad right now hes really motivated and he comes ill be honest with you if hes in new york city he comes every day he always finds the time for fitness and health its really impressive for me because i know how busy he is we all know how busy he is with real housewives watch what happens live radio show in the mornings  like wow

i have my own style the way i train clients and my training routine for andy is a lot of supersets stan told us i combine a lot of weights with the body weight meaning lets say we do chest and back well do jumping jacks in between or crunches some exercise that keeps your heart rate always elevated

so youre basically doing your weightlifting and youre doing your cardio as well he went on burning body fat working your muscles keeping you busy youre getting the most that you can in a onehour session

during that onehour session though andys admittedly glued to his phone but stan actually believes that works in both of their favors

noting the calls texts and emails are a combination of work and personal stan told us the funny part about andy is that hes motivated he comes every day right and hes busy hes like oh my god i have a conference call and im like sure i found it really working well with him because hes less resistant to me when i tell him oh todays leg day were doing some legs hes like ugh fk okay well do it but when hes on the phone call i get him to do doublesquats and he doesnt even realize it

of course we needed to know if stans ever overheard a call with a housewife or been privy to any show drama but he said andy leaves all of that at the door when its time to work out

hes an optimistic guy he leaves his drama at home stan said me if i have something dramatically happen im like all day sad it affects me but with him he knows how to balance it out he comes to the sessions with no drama nothing all good thats what i respect and thats what i really like about him because he knows how to balance out everything in life its very impressive

but not everyone has andy cohens neverending energy or financial means to pay for a personal trainer so whats stans advice to working parents who struggle to find the time to exercise neou its a livestreaming service program that allows users to work out at home at a gym or on the go with fitness classes and routines courtesy of trainers like stan

its me this is what i love this is what i do he said adding that finding balance in life is key

garbutt started on the bench in last weeks victory over wakefield trinity and produced a typically tenacious performance in his first game back after knee surgery

smith expects the prop to back up at the kcom stadium but abdull could miss the short trip to former club hull fc after sustaining an unspecified injury in the super league opener

lahore umar akmal is likely to find himself in hot water with the pakistan cricket board pcb once more after he is said to have misbehaved with staff during a fitness test at the national cricket academy nca

the junior akmal is believed to have exposed himself in frustration during one test and now finds himself facing the prospect of being kicked out of the next domestic tournament

akmals elder brother kamran is also expected to land in trouble after both brothers failed their fitness tests by significant margins

salman butt too could be in trouble with the authorities after he stormed out of a fitness test when his request to have it rescheduled was denied

the shortcomings of the akmal brothers around their fitness regimes has been a talking point for several years now with umar last falling foul of the pcb management on this count under former head coach mickey arthur he was sent home on the eve of the champions trophy in 2017 after a failed fitness test

kamran meanwhile has not played for pakistan since 2017 with his lack of athleticism in the outfield a major reason for his prolonged exclusion

the perception that the akmal brothers have never quite bought into the importance of maintaining rigorous fitness standards hasnt helped their chances and for all the changes that misbahulhaq has sought to bring since taking over from arthur the managements commitment to high fitness standards remains undiluted

misbah has sought to impose the same high standards in domestic cricket with each provincial side required to regulate fitness tests on a quarterly basis

cricinfo understands umars behavior fell short of the mark during the skinfold test when he exposed himself completely in front of the trainer and is said to have asked him where is the fat

according to kamran umar did it in mischief and said it was simply a misunderstanding the pcb confirmed to cricinfo that they were fully aware of the matter and looking at potential punishments in the context of bringing the game into disrepute umar could potentially be axed from the upcoming domestic oneday cup

kamran meanwhile skipped two fitness tests before ending up failing in nearly all departments when he finally did take one central punjabs squad was called up at the nca in batches with kamran scheduled to appear for his test on january 11 he skipped that test purportedly because he had a photoshoot with peshawar zalmi his test was then pushed back to january 20 only for him to opt out informing the management he was suffering from a bout of fever he would undertake his test on january 28 alongside his brother with both falling well short of the required benchmarks

i had informed the management each time i didnt come kamran told cricinfo i had reasons and i came on january 28 for the test as far result is concerned you will see an improvement in the next test after the psl

misbah has been repeatedly asked about kamrans absence from the national side most recently for the test squad to face bangladesh in the first test at rawalpindi stadium on saturday ; evin lewis and shimron hetmyer have been omitted from west indies odi squad for the tour of sri lanka after failing fitness tests
