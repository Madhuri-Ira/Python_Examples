he now wants people at large to put a premium on fitness and wellness

by ushering in the new age sports and medical care hitherto unseen in india the countrys lone individual olympic gold medallist is helping improve the lives of people outside the sporting arena

that is the need of the hour the 37yearold the brainchild behind the abhinav bindra targeting performance abtp told pti in a telephonic interview

the work that i have been doing revolved around prevention of injuries proper rehabilitation it revolved around well being and holistic approach the champion shooter added

daivam wellness indias first functional medicine centre has tied up with bindras abtp and asked about the collaboration he said this happened because of similar visions

it is very similar to what daivam really does like lifestyle  going to the route cause of the problem the philosophy is same

it is really the need of the hour what the people in the country need is meeting of minds between similar philosophy for betterment and well being of people

he is trying to ensure the best global practices in either prevention of injuries or treatment of injuries are accessible to the people at large

sport is always the inspiration behind what we do we do a lot of work on prevention of injuries lifestyle related issues which has resulted in a lot of structural imbalances and the technology that we have allows us to make everything much more accountable and completely data driven said bindra

abtp has five centres  in pune new delhi mohali bengaluru and bhubaneswar

with technology we are able to employ assessment protocol which then allows us to evaluate what the imbalances are and then a customised programme is made he said

from back ache to rehabilitation athletes and people at large go to these centres

bindra says wellness is also absolutely important for sportspersons

an athlete is also a human being once we take care of wellbeing of an athlete then performance will automatically come an athlete is not a robot not a machine wellbeing of athletes is absolute necessary

his real goal also is to go to the grassroots identify talent and provide them scientific training and rehabilitation facilities something he feels can help make a big impact in our performance

asked about awareness he said there is much more awareness than before we have to train the whole ecosystem and only when we take this to the base level we will start to make a real impact

sanjay sachdeva founder  ceo daivam wellness is delighted with the association

as part of daivams journey to enable complete wellbeing in every persons life through the integration of various aspects of their life it is imperative to join hands with organisations who are equally in sync with this ideal as well sachdeva said

q how different is pilates from the regular gym

yasmin every form of exercise or sport has a different intention as to why it was invented for example martial arts were invented for self defence yoga was invented as a means to be closer to your spiritual self and the gym or weight lifting was invented for building muscle using weights pilates was invented for one reason alone to make the human body move as efficiently as possible if your biceps are stronger than your triceps your arm will not move efficiently if you have a six pack or strong rectus abdominis muscles but weak back muscles you will end up injuring yourself pilates ensures that your entirely body develops long lean muscles evenly throughout the front and back the upper and lower hemispheres so that the body can move as efficiently as possible when your body moves efficiently it saves energy which can be used in other parts of your life pilates literally makes you move better and live better

it is the perfect combination between strength training and stretching

it nonaggressive form of exercise with incredible results

it works on your posture and strengthens your spine and all the muscles around it

it helps to strengthen your core and when your core is strong all other movements in life get easier and better

it forces you to breathe for an hour which makes you feel rejuvenated and refreshed while giving you a great workout

q what is your fitness regime

yasmin i do one hour of pilates a day and 1 hour of cardio everyday sunday is my rest day where i make sure i get a massage

q how important is it for people especially women to understand the importance of being fit rather than thin

yasmin it is extremely important to be fit women run behind being thin and a certain size whereas what is more important is your energy levels during the day and how you are feeling how much you are able to accomplish and how easily you are able to do your daily tasks whats the point of being thin and weak rather be fit and strong ; mysuru january 31 to inculcate an health conscious mindset and keep oneself agile the mysuru district police personnel on friday early morning took time out to sweat out in a different environment as part of fitness programme and climbed the through the foot steps to reach the chamundi hill

last year marked an eventful season for the indian womens team as it booked its ticket to 2020 olympics where for the first time in the history of the game it will make backtoback appearances

the team also scripted creditable victories against quality sides like spain ireland japan china korea among other countries last year while defeating higher ranked teams like new zealand and great britain in 2020

the starting of the olympic year has been good specially because last year we managed to qualify for tokyo since then womens hockeys graph is going well in the last three years the team has done quite well rani told pti

the skipper feels south african wayne patrick lombard who was appointed as the scientific advisor of the womens team in 2017 has made a significant contribution in improving the fitness level of the players something the squad had lacked earlier

the combination of fitness and skill has been great earlier we used to lag behind in fitness but that has improved in the last three years wayne lombard has worked really hard with the team personally and individually she said

in todays time if the fitness is good we can play well but if there is no fitness even the skill wont help she said

rani who currently has more than 240 caps for india feels the improved level of fitness has brought a belief in the players that they can beat any team irrespective of the rankings

it has boosted the teams confidence they are not scared of facing any side also because these days ranking doesnt mean much whoever performs better on that given day wins she said

we are concentrating on our game more than others our competition every day is with ourselves how we can perform better and better

former dutch hockey player janneke schopman has joined the indian womens side as an analytical coach last month and rani feels the olympic gold medallist has made breakthroughs in her very first tour

she herself is an olympic gold medallist so she is realistically aware of the team how the players feel she has also helped us on the mental side she tells us small small things that have helped us a lot in the new zealand tour rani said

talking about the tokyo olympics the skipper said the team needs to take one game at a time and avoid being overwhelmed

we have to utilise all the chances that we get we cant break the structure if we break that we lose

we will take one game at a time in the pool stage we have to plan match by match not rush ourselves saying that we need to win all five matches in the pool stage and once we reach the quarterfinals it is anyones game she said

on the personal front rani who has been a member of the national team since she was a 15yearold became the firstever hockey player to win the prestigious world games athlete of the year award last month and the 25yearold feels it is the biggest recognition for womens hockey

delighted to be the first womens hockey player to win the award  this is the biggest recognition for womens hockey and it feels nice when womens hockey gets such a recognition she concluded ; new delhi february 5 ianslife some of the extreme sports such as bungee jumping giant swing and water rafting which demand extreme courage and mental strength have gained unprecedented momentum here in india the adventure sports participants go beyond their limits to explore their inner potency with many having gained an improved life state
